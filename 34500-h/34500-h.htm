THE GOLD BRICK.</h2>

<hr class="hr3" />

<h2><a name="i" id="i"></a>CHAPTER I.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">THE MASSACRE.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A low</span> coast, burdened in every foot of its soil with the luxuriant
growth of a tropical climate; a large town, straggling and flat,
swarming like a hive of bees with turbulent life. Lights flickering
wildly from the windows and dancing with a fantastic and red glare up
and down the streets. A dull, hollow sound rolling constantly out upon
the stillness of the waters, broken now and then with sharp shrieks as
lightning cleaves the thunder gust.</p>

<p>This was the scene commanded from the deck of a New England brig, lying
in the harbor of Port au Prince, on one of those terrible nights in the
end of the last century, when the horrible passions that had rioted
through France, like wild beasts ravening for blood, fled across seas
and fired themselves anew in the hot life of the tropics.</p>

<p>The contrast between the stillness of the harbor, where the starlight
fell smilingly, and the waters rippled like kisses around the vessels,
and that demon riot on the shore, was awful. To lie so near, with death
shrieks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span> cutting the air every instant, with murderous yells chasing
them, like fiends, was enough to drive men mad. The iron-hearted New
England sailors on that deck, grew restive as caged lions, while the
tumult swelled louder and louder around them. The young captain turned
white as he took short marches up and down the deck. The men drew close
together, eyeing each other with fierce glances. A word from the captain
would have sent them headlong into the massacre, in a wild effort to
save the women and children, whose shrieks, even from the distance,
drove them frantic.</p>

<p>But what could they do?&mdash;a handful of men against thousands on thousands
of brutalized blacks, swarming in that doomed city. It was terrible to
remain, but madness to go. The captain ground his teeth and clenched his
hands in the agony of this restraint. Every cry that reached the ship
pierced him like a sword; every fresh gleam of light quivering across
the waters seemed to lure him to the rescue.</p>

<p>"Oh, my God! my God! I cannot bear this!" he cried, as a group of wooden
buildings near the shore burst into a volume of fire, and one appalling
shriek told that scores on scores of human beings were engulphed in the
flames that danced and leaped and shed floods of fiery gold far out on
the harbor. "Neither my owners nor my Maker could wish me to stand still
now."</p>

<p>Going up to the group of sailors, he called out, "All hands to work, my
boys! lower the boats. Such of you as want to help the poor wretches
they are murdering yonder, come with me."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye," broke in a smothered shout from the sailors, and each man
sprang to his duty&mdash;from cabin boy to mate, not a soul lagged behind.
Yes, one man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span> the first mate, he neither repeated his superior's
orders, or moved toward the boats, but stood near the captain, looking
quietly unconcerned, with a half smile on his lip.</p>

<p>"You will not go, Thrasher," said the captain. "I am glad of it; some
one must take charge of the ship. Stay on board, and be ready to lend a
hand&mdash;we may bring back some of those poor creatures."</p>

<p>"And if your men are killed, who will work the ship, Captain Mason?
Remember the craft belongs neither to you nor me."</p>

<p>"They shall not be killed, Thrasher, these brutes have plenty to do
without minding us; besides, I'll keep off shore, and only lie to, ready
to haul any poor creature in that takes to the water. They are sure to
try, if they think of the ship."</p>

<p>"Well, well, captain, you command here, and know your own business
best," answered Thrasher, with that same smile creeping across his lips;
"for my part, I stand by the ship."</p>

<p>"That's right; I won't risk the men&mdash;never fear! As for the brig, what
can harm her?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, while I'm aboard," answered the mate, turning suddenly
townward, where another broad sheet of smoky flame blazed forth.
"There," he cried, almost with a shout, "there goes another bonfire. The
whole town will be roaring hot at this rate. Ha, look at that flock of
women rushing out of the smoke like rats&mdash;hot work that&mdash;how plainly you
can see 'em with their hair in the wind, turning and rushing hither and
yon, between fire and water! Ho, ho, the black rascals are after
'em&mdash;Lord, how they run!&mdash;how they fling up their arms toward the
ship&mdash;scatter on the beach&mdash;take to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span> water&mdash;they're on 'em&mdash;the
nigger hounds are on 'em tooth and nail. What an infernal yell!"</p>

<p>Even that hard man turned away and covered his face with both hands;
when he looked again it was with wild, heavy eyes.</p>

<p>"Heavens and earth," he muttered, "how still it is in spite of the
roaring pit behind. The brutes have done their work, and gone into the
smoke again. How softly the waves lick up the dead bodies from the sand
and sweep 'em under. But they'll come to daylight again; perhaps here
under our bows, a hundred women&mdash;who knows how many&mdash;with long hair,
weltering up and down like sea-weed after a storm. Faugh! the dread of
it makes one childish. I wonder if they are all gone. What, ho!"</p>

<p>Two persons, the cook and cabin-boy, had been left behind by the boats,
much against their will. They, also, had witnessed the fearful scene on
the beach, and shuddering with terror, crouched together behind some
barrels that stood upon the deck. One of them tried to answer Thrasher's
shout, but his voice broke in a hoarse whisper, and he really had
neither the strength nor courage to move.</p>

<p>By this time the captain's boat was nearing the shore rapidly. If the
scene of revolt had been terrible from the distance, it was crowded with
horrors now. The fierce, hot breath of the fire came surging toward the
coast like a sirocco. The roar of that infernal massacre, the pleadings
and shrieks, the moans and shouts, horribly mingling and rising above
each other, oppressed the very air. Out of the reeking melee of the town
human beings darted like scared birds, and hid among the chaparral or
rushed madly toward the beach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
The captain was brave and humane, but he was honest too, and in the
midst of all this gave a thought to the obligations he owed to his
command. He would go close to the shore, ready to save those who fled to
the water for death or refuge. If it proved possible for the nature
within him to resist the temptation to offer more, he would resist; if
not, he was but human, and life was a precious thing to every breathing
being; God would forgive him for saving it, though his owners might not.</p>

<p>As he neared the shore, that portion of the town which lay close to the
water was in a bright blaze; the boat, the wharves, and the foam-fringed
waves reddened and glowed under the hot smiles of the fire. Deep into
the lurid caves made by the whirl of glowing smoke men and women
struggled madly, and tore at each other like wild beasts, smothering
their yells beneath the tumultuous elements.</p>

<p>From this lurid torrent the people scattered, both pursuers and pursued,
out upon the open country. The poor wretches who were to die sought the
darkest spots, hiding behind clumps of aloes and cactus hedges, or
creeping under torn masses of wild vines, panting with terror and dread,
and striving to hold the very breath that threatened to betray them.</p>

<p>Secure of their victims in the end, the triumphant hordes of negroes
came huddling forth like demons, hooting, dancing, and rioting in the
brazen light their own fiends' work had kindled. A group of palm trees
stood close to the shore a little distance from the town, and to that
point the insurgents swarmed in hundreds, dragging the pale beings whose
death was to be their sport, brutally after them. When they reached the
palm trees there was a rush from the crowd, and a score<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span> of dark objects
leaped upon the slender stems, struggling upward, hustling over each
other, the lowermost seizing his neighbor by the bare, glistening
shoulders and hurling him down to the crowd amid wild shouts and stormy
oaths.</p>

<p>At last the palms swayed and bent almost double under the burden of
fiends, who dropped off by dozens into the yelling crowd. The beautiful
trees, relieved of their weight, swayed back and penciled themselves
against the flaming sky, not green and free as they had appeared a
moment before; but with the bark torn from their delicate trunks, and
the symmetrical foliage broken and ragged. From the point of each leaf
flaunted a gorgeous scarf or tawdry ribbon&mdash;red, orange, purple, and
flame colored&mdash;which fluttered wildly in the hot draughts of wind that
swept over them from the burning town.</p>

<p>Out from the crowd, like sharks leaping in the black waves of a tempest,
the negro women sprang upward, seizing the ribbons, tearing them away
from the leaves, or bending down the stately trees until they took
uncouth forms, and seemed tortured like the group of women and children
whose death cries rang out from the midst of the fiendish dance. The
mingled mirth and horror grew more and more maddening, till the sand all
around refused to soak in the blood they had shed, and the naked feet of
the dancers plashed to their own barbarous war cry, or stumbled over the
dead bodies of the slain; for with every turn of the dance, an axe had
fallen, and a soul gone shrieking up to its Maker.</p>

<p>Captain Mason saw all this from his boat, while it was far out in the
harbor; with a cry of horror he seized the oars and worked them till
they bent like saplings under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span> his iron handling. But human strength was
not equal to human cruelty. While he was yet some fathoms from the
shore, the demons under the palm trees, scattered back to the town in
search of fresh victims, leaving the dead and the dying to their
agonies, with those mocking ribbons waving fantastically in the wind, as
if a May dance had just passed beneath them.</p>

<p>Panting and breathless, their hearts burning with indignation, the
captain and his men rested on their oars; their work of mercy cut short,
for alas! rage is quicker than charity. They could see the pale, dead
faces of the white women and children that had been murdered under the
palm trees, with terrible distinctness. Their rich garments and delicate
features, bespoke them of the higher classes, but there they lay, like
soldiers heaped on a battle-field, with nothing but the stars of heaven
to pity them&mdash;the pure stars that seemed affrighted by the tumult, and
grew pallid in the smoke.</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="ii" id="ii"></a>CHAPTER II.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">THE JEWEL BOX.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the captain sat with his face toward the palm trees, he saw a woman
rise up from among the dead, and turn first toward the town, then
seaward, in a wild despairing search for help.</p>

<p>The captain stood up in his boat and shouted aloud, while all hands
pulled for the shore.</p>

<p>She heard him, reeled back against the stem of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span> nearest palm tree,
and clung to it, waving her hand toward the boat. But as they looked, a
young boy was standing at her side, grasping her garments with his hand,
while his face was turned toward the boat. He seemed urging her to flee.
Twice her arm was unwound from the palm, and a step tried, but she fell
back again, as if severely hurt or frightened out of her strength. The
boy still pleaded. They could see it in his gestures, in the eager hand
that motioned toward the shore, which the boat almost touched.</p>

<p>He pointed this out; he pulled frantically at her garments; he fell upon
his knees, lifting his clasped hands toward her imploringly.</p>

<p>Something gave her desperate strength. She left the palm, staggered, and
sprang forward, more than keeping pace with the boy, who, clinging to
her hand, rushed on with his great, wild eyes, uplifted to her face.</p>

<p>The captain sprang on shore, and met them on the verge of the surf. The
woman reeled toward him blindly, with both hands outstretched, and fell
into his arms headlong, as she must have fallen on the sand but for his
presence.</p>

<p>He gathered her to his broad bosom, and wading through the surf, waist
deep, laid her in the boat, upon a pile of jackets that his men
hurriedly took off their persons, and cast at his feet.</p>

<p>She was coldly pale, and did not seem to breathe. But the captain had no
time to remark this or any thing else. A group of negroes who had been
pursuing their death work among the cactus hedges, saw the boy and
turned upon him.</p>

<p>The lad saw them, and with a desperate bound, leaped into the
surf&mdash;struggled, lost his foothold, and was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span> the very sweep of the
undertow, when the captain snatched him away. The savages hurled their
sharp missiles after him, which the water swallowed instantly. So, as
they were without firearms, the boy was saved, while his pursuers raged
and hooted on the shore.</p>

<p>When the boy saw his mother lying so pale and still in the boat, he
struggled from the captain's arms, and kneeling by her side, pressed the
beautiful face&mdash;for it was beautiful&mdash;between his little trembling
hands, while in the purest and most pathetic French he besought her to
look up. He told her that they were safe now&mdash;away on the sea, where
nothing could hurt them. He entreated her to wake up, only for one
minute, just long enough to kiss him, and then she might go to sleep
again for ever so long.</p>

<p>The touching anguish in the boy's voice would have called any mother
back to life. She opened her eyes; a look of divine tenderness came
softly to her face, and died in a smile upon her lips, as the boy bent
down with a gush of tearful gladness and kissed her.</p>

<p>"There," he said, touching her raven hair with infinite tenderness, "go
to sleep now. Paul will sit by and watch."</p>

<p>She seemed to understand him, for a serene smile beamed on her face, and
softly as white rose-leaves fall, the lids drooped over her eyes.</p>

<p>The child was satisfied, and looking up at the captain, said&mdash;"Yes, yes,
she will have a sweet, long sleep. We will not wake her&mdash;I promised, you
know. If I forget, and begin to kiss her, don't let me, please, sir, for
she always wakes, and smiles, when I do that. How softly the boat rocks!
Oh, it will make her well."</p>

<p>The captain turned away his face, for he knew how long that sleep would
be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Slowly and sadly they rowed toward the ship. Fire and massacre raged
behind them, but there was safety and solemn stillness on the waters.
The boy clung to his mother's garments, and drooped his head wearily.
The motion of the boat&mdash;the soft stars, smiling down, and scattering
their broken images on the waves&mdash;affected him peacefully. He longed to
fall asleep with his mother; but somehow the idea that she needed his
care, kept the lids from sinking entirely over those beautiful eyes.</p>

<p>At last the boat drew close to the sides of the brig. The captain
attempted to take the boy in his arms and carry him on board. But the
little fellow struggled manfully, and insisted that his mother should be
carried up first. Captain Mason, with his imperfect knowledge of French,
understood this, for the child's face was more eloquent than words; but
the men only comprehended his gestures, and interposed their
superstitions against his generous wishes.</p>

<p>"No," they protested, with sullen determination, "the woman is
dead&mdash;what have we to do with a corpse on board the brig? Ain't the
signs agin her bad enough, without that one? Hoist the youngster aboard,
captain, and let us row the boat over to White's Island, and bury the
poor critter there!"</p>

<p>The child turned upon the sailors and searched their faces eagerly, as
if he guessed that they were planning something against him. The men
dropped their gloomy eyes beneath his glances, but were not the less
resolved.</p>

<p>Captain Mason knew the superstition of his men too well for any idea of
opposing it while his ship lay in that dangerous neighborhood. He cast
one pitying look on the beautiful young woman who lay at his feet, in
her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span> calm, eternal slumber, then tenderly addressed the boy: "Your
mother is asleep, let her stay here," he said, in very confused French.
But the attention of the boy was keenly directed; he understood clearly,
and sat down, folding his little arms with a pleading smile.</p>

<p>"Me too?" he said.</p>

<p>"No, my child, you shall go on deck and wait while the boat rocks here.
All shall go, and leave your mother to sleep alone."</p>

<p>"Is it best?" inquired the boy; "will she sleep longer if we go?"</p>

<p>"Yes, poor orphan, her sleep will be long enough," cried the captain,
all his generous sympathy bursting forth in English.</p>

<p>"What!" said the boy, gently, "will her sleep be sweeter&mdash;did you say
that? Lift me up, I will go. Let one of those big men put me on his
shoulder. I shan't be afraid. My father is&mdash;oh, how brave!&mdash;so am I."
The captain lifted the little fellow in his arms, and held him against
as good and true a heart as ever beat in man's bosom&mdash;a heart pained
with many compunctions by the humane deception he was compelled to
practice. The men made the boat fast, and came up the side of the brig,
leaving it rocking softly on the water.</p>

<p>"Wait till he is asleep," the captain said, as they stood in a group,
anxious for orders. "Then we will take her to the island."</p>

<p>The men retired, somewhat dissatisfied at any delay, but made no further
protest.</p>

<p>"Let me sit here, please, where I can look over and see her face as she
sleeps," said the gentle child, in a sweet, pleading way, that went to
that captain's heart; "besides, I want to watch for papa. When the
negroes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span> dragged us away, mamma and I&mdash;he followed after a little while,
and when I looked back and he was lying on the ground, tired with
running, I suppose; but he'll come, so if you don't mind, monsieur, I'll
just wait here."</p>

<p>The boy had clambered up to a cask that stood near the side of the
vessel, as he spoke, and folding his arms on the bulwarks, looked down
with touching watchfulness upon the face of his mother, which lay, white
as marble, in the starlight.</p>

<p>How beautiful, and how patient was that childlike watch. Sometimes the
boy would lift his eyes with a troubled look, and turn them toward the
town, which, still glaring and riotous, kept up its atrocious noises.
Then he would search the harbor for some boat, and finding none, sink to
his patient watch again, murmuring, "Oh, but he will come, when it is
daylight&mdash;when it is daylight."</p>

<p>At last the struggles of nature were too strong for a child so
delicately nurtured, and with his little arms folded on the bulwark he
dropped into a profound sleep. But it was almost break of day before he
became thus unconscious, and the captain had no time to spare. Taking
the little fellow once more in his arms he laid him on his own bed, and
going instantly on deck, summoned his men. With eager alacrity they
descended to the boat. The captain followed with a large cloak over his
arm, with which he reverently covered the dead. One man brought a
pickaxe and spade, which he had taken from the cargo, and sat them in
the stern of the boat; now that all danger of a dead person being
carried aboard was over, they went quietly and seriously to their
duties. As they gave the boat to her oars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> every arm fell softly to its
work, it seemed as if they feared that a single splash of water would be
followed by wails of pain from the poor child whose mother was floating
away into eternity while he dreamed.</p>

<p>Across the waters and through the gray gleams of early dawn the boat cut
its way to White's Island&mdash;which as yet was calm and peaceful. In a
jungle of roses, where lofty cedars sheltered the beautiful coffee
trees, the sailors dug a grave, leaving the murdered woman in the boat
till their work was done. The captain, saddened by this individual
instance of wrong, sat down upon the bank watching the boat, while his
men completed their task. Once or twice he heard a movement in the
chaparral, as if some wild animal were disturbed by his presence, but he
took no heed, and at last his men came back.</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="iii" id="iii"></a>CHAPTER III.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">THE BURIAL.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Captain Mason</span> would not leave that delicate creature to his men, but
folding his cloak carefully around her, supported her head as she was
lifted from the boat. Under the bending trees and through the fragrant
shrubs they carried her, with hushed voices and cautious steps; for
wrapped in the stillness of the morning there was something awful in
that hastily prepared burial which penetrated to the hearts of those New
England sailors as no ceremony could have done. But the vines,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> that
fell in garlands from the trees, and the flowering branches which they
were compelled to sweep aside, made the passage difficult. Once a
patriarch aloe, which had shot up its great spikes of yellow blossoms
for the first time in that year of blood, caught an ornament of the
cloak on one of its sharp leaves and tore it from the dead, leaving the
beautiful face and the long, sweeping hair exposed.</p>

<p>That instant there arose a fierce, rustling sound in the chaparral,
followed by a cry that made the sailors pause in their holy work. The
captain, pained by this sudden exposure of the dead, stooped, and with
one hand strove to gather up the cloak which was now drawn entirely
away, and trailed like a pall along the path they had taken. But at that
instant a powerful negro tore a passage through the chaparral, and
throwing himself on the ground, seized upon the garments of the dead
lady, and broke into a passion of grief so wild and poignant that the
sailors looked at each other awe-stricken.</p>

<p>"Is she dead&mdash;is she dead?" cried the negro, in wild, broken French,
which the captain could hardly understand. "My mistress&mdash;my
beautiful&mdash;beautiful mistress. They have killed her&mdash;why did she send
Jube away?&mdash;where is the little master?&mdash;where is monsieur? All dead,
all murdered, burned, trampled in the ashes."</p>

<p>"Did you know this lady?" said the captain, in his broken French. "Did
you know her?"</p>

<p>The man looked up; tears rained down his face, and he sobbed out an
incoherent answer amid plaintive moans over his mistress, for such
evidently the lady had been.</p>

<p>"Me know her&mdash;me that swung her first hammock on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> the
<a name="mango" id="mango"></a><ins title="Original has mangoe">mango</ins>
trees&mdash;me! ah, strange master, tell me, is she dead? gone forever and
ever? no more smiles, no more sweet words for Jube when he brings her
fruit."</p>

<p>"Get up, poor fellow, get up, and let us pass," said the captain, in a
kindly voice. "She is dead, and it is dangerous to wait."</p>

<p>The man drew back, but still kept on his knees. "And the master," he
said piteously.</p>

<p>"I can tell you nothing of him," said the captain; "but the boy, the
little one, is safe in my ship yonder."</p>

<p>The negro sprang to his feet, searched for the ship with eager glances,
and began to clasp and wring his hands in alternate paroxysms of grief
and joy.</p>

<p>"The little master! The poor, poor mistress!" he kept exclaiming.</p>

<p>"Come, let us pass," said the captain, a little impatiently, for the
morning had dawned, and rays of soft, rosy light flushed the sky, and
fell trembling on the water. "Let us pass, we are not safe a minute
here."</p>

<p>The negro stood aside, shaking with grief, and when the funereal group
had passed him half a dozen paces, he followed it with his head bowed
down, and his clasped hands falling heavily before him. Thus he stood
till the body was placed in its shallow grave, but when the first
shovelful of earth was lifted, he came forward with both hands extended
imploringly, and pushed the spade back. An orange tree stood near, on
which the yellow fruit and white blossoms hung clustering together among
the fragrant leaves; the negro went to this tree, seized one of the most
richly laden boughs, and tore the blossoming branches away with both
hands. Then he gathered them eagerly up, carried them to the grave, and
over the body of his mistress he scattered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> flowers till the turf
all around was flooded with fragrance, like an altar at some holy
festival.</p>

<p>When this was done the poor fellow drew back, and covering his face with
his hands, stood trembling in all his limbs till the sailors had done
their work, and dragged some shrubs and vines over the earth under which
his murdered lady&mdash;more fortunate than thousands massacred that fatal
night&mdash;had found a death shelter.</p>

<p>The sailors moved away from the grave they had made, but the negro did
not look up, and they started for the boat, leaving him behind. Then the
stillness aroused him, and as the party neared the shore, he followed
with a look of painful entreaty in his face, begging to go with them to
the ship.</p>

<p>The captain made a prompt motion for him to come on; but gesticulating
energetically for them to wait, he ran back to the spot where they had
first seen him, stooping downward, he began to tear up the earth with
both hands, flinging the leaves and sods on one side in wild haste, only
pausing to entreat their patience, with a pitiful glance of the eyes. At
last he dropped on his knees, lifted something from the hole he had dug,
and came forward with the moist soil dropping from his hands, which were
clutched tightly around a bronze box. He followed the men into the boat,
and sat down hugging the box to his bosom, and muttering to himself in
hurried, eager words, which no one present understood.</p>

<p>When they reached the ship the negro climbed up the sides like a cat.
Once on the deck, he ran back and forth, searching every corner. Then,
with a despairing cry, he sprang upon the bulwarks, lifted the box over
his head, and poised himself for a plunge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
The captain saw this desperate attempt, threw both arms around the
negro, and dragged him back upon the deck.</p>

<p>The poor fellow scrambled to his knees, and looking up with pitiful
abjectness, said:</p>

<p>"He is not here&mdash;the young master is not here; you said he was."</p>

<p>"Get up and come this way, my poor fellow!" said the captain, touched by
the humble pathos of his disappointment.</p>

<p>The negro sprang up and seized the box, which had fallen with a crash on
the deck.</p>

<p>"I come, master, I come."</p>

<p>"Hush!" said the kind-hearted sailor, pointing to his berth as they
entered the cabin. "Hush! and tell me if that is your young master."</p>

<p>The negro drew in his breath with a sob, and scarcely seemed to respire
after that. He crept close up to the berth, and looked down upon the boy
with a glow in his black face that it is impossible to describe, for
every ugly feature quivered with tenderness, while his eyes filled with
light, like those of a Newfoundland dog when he has done brave work for
his master.</p>

<p>"What will you do with us, strange master?" he said at last, addressing
the captain in a humble whisper. "Not send us back yonder?"</p>

<p>He made a motion toward the town with his hand, and a slow horror crept
over his face.</p>

<p>"No, my poor fellow, I will take the child to my own thrice-blessed
land, if there is no one left to claim him."</p>

<p>"And Jube&mdash;let him go too. If the strange master wants a slave, Jube is
strong, like a lion, and honest as a dog."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
"Poor fellow!"</p>

<p>"See if Jube is not honest," he added, pressing the bronze box between
his hands, and forcing some secret spring to recoil. "They told Jube to
keep them, and he did. The master went back after mis&mdash;went after them.
Jube wanted to go with him, but the master said, 'No, stay on the
island, and guard that;' so Jube staid, waiting&mdash;waiting&mdash;waiting for
master to come with mistress and the little boy. He never
come&mdash;never&mdash;never will come again. The mistress sleeps! but where shall
Jube go to find him, and give back the box?"</p>

<p>"My poor fellow, I fear your master is dead, from some words I gathered
from the boy; I am almost sure of it."</p>

<p>"You will take the little boy and Jube away?" said the negro, anxiously,
still holding the box half-shut between his hands.</p>

<p>"If no one comes to claim him or you, I will."</p>

<p>The lid of the box flew open, and a ray of sunshine from the cabin
window flashed upon the jewels with which it was filled&mdash;diamond
necklaces, bracelets flaming with rubies and emeralds, ropes of oriental
pearls, and armlets flashing like rainbows, broke the sunshine into
sparkles of fire.</p>

<p>Mason looked wonderingly on the eager face of the negro.</p>

<p>"And this treasure&mdash;did it belong to your master?" he questioned. "Was
it to guard this, you hid in the chaparral at White Island?"</p>

<p>"All his; more, more, much more in the great house out there; but heavy
gold&mdash;too heavy&mdash;we had to leave it and go back. He went&mdash;wouldn't take
Jube&mdash;master went, but never he comes to see if Jube is faithful!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
"And all this belongs to the little fellow yonder. God help him!"</p>

<p>"You take little boy&mdash;take the box, and take Jube; he gives you all!"</p>

<p>Jube closed the box, dropped on both knees, and held it up.</p>

<p>Captain Mason hesitated, looked at the sleeping child and its strange
guardian, shrinking from the trust which chance had imposed upon him.
But he felt that a sacred duty was placed before him, from which no
honest man should wish to retreat.</p>

<p>He took the box, but as his hands touched the metal a cold chill crept
to his heart, and a mist floated before his eyes&mdash;an unstable, reddish
mist, such as floods a room when the light is filtered through crimson
drapery.</p>

<p>Perhaps the red curtain had fluttered before the cabin window; but if
so, he felt the startling effect without knowing its cause, and the box
shook in his hands, till the jewels within gave forth a faint sound.</p>

<p>"You will take us," pleaded the negro, frightened by the change in
Captain Mason's countenance.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the brave man, casting off the feeling that had seized
upon him; "I accept the trust; God has placed it in my hands. As I
discharge it, may he prove merciful to me and mine."</p>

<p>The captain spoke to himself, and from the feelings that filled his
heart, rather than in reply to the negro; but the expression of his face
was full of grand resolve, which the slave could read better than
language. So he looked on with a glow of satisfaction while the box was
packed up among the most valuable property the captain possessed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
All this time the cabin door had been ajar, and but for the excitement
consequent to the scene, Captain Mason might have heard cautious steps
creeping down the stairs, and the suppressed breathing of a man who
skulked on the lowest steps, with his greedy eyes fixed on the jewels,
as they flashed that one minute in the negro's hands. The listener
waited until he saw the treasure put safely away, and heard the
captain's promise. Then he went up the steps, two at a time, with soft,
cautious leaps, like those of a fox, and when the captain came on deck,
his mate was busy superintending the boat, as it was hauled to its
fastenings.</p>

<h2><a name="iv" id="iv"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">THE FAITHFUL SLAVE.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> France, the awful strife of the Revolution had sprung out of
oppressions heaped by one class upon another, from century to century,
until the people began to comprehend the powers that lay in mere
physical strength, and hurled themselves in a phrensy of hate on their
oppressors. But even Paris, whose awful example had run like wildfire
all over France and its dependencies, plunged into its carnival of blood
with far less ferocity than marked this outbreak of Negroes in St.
Domingo. In Paris, it was an upheaving of classes, marked and
established by men of kindred blood, and born to the same soil. A
struggle of men clamorous for their birthright of freedom, which they
were determined to wrest from the strong hand of power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Ages of oppression could not be hurled off thus suddenly, without
horrible carnage. But there, it was the people against a
government&mdash;white men struggling against white men. In a mighty effort
to upheave the foundations of despotism, the people grew mad. In their
ardor for liberty, and in the ignorance of her very visage, they
trampled her in the dust, setting up red handed murder in her place,
dealing death on every hand, as they hurled themselves with mighty force
on their oppressors and trampled upon them with that ferocious hate
continual wrongs will ever engender. But in the hot tropics, this
struggle became a war of races, the most fierce, terrible, and
relentless that humanity has yet known. It became a war of blacks
against whites. Slaves against their masters. Where hate and ignorance
hurled their massive strength against luxurious refinement. The
brightest features of this horrible struggle were the murders that gave
Paris so many blood red pages in history, pages that all her after
greatness and glory will never have power to wash white.</p>

<p>The massacre of St. Domingo was one of intense hate. The black slave,
brutalized by the chains he wore, stood on every hearthstone ready for
revenge on his white master. That which followed was not merely a
massacre but a hurried carnival of ruin, a riot of awful passions, of
atrocities for which there is no language, and from which the
imagination revolts with sickening inability of comprehension.</p>

<p>Of all the horrors perpetrated in the French Revolution, which was one
great horror in itself, that of St. Domingo was the most brutal the most
demoniac. And such a war of races&mdash;a war between white men and negroes
must ever be. With the despotism of long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span> established power, luxurious
ease, and pampered intelligence, opposed to the hot blood of Africa,
scarcely subdued from its first savage state, fired by the memory of
slave ships, chains, starvation, barter, and above all, the wild freedom
which preceded these wrongs, who can wonder at the scenes which made
that lovely island a purgatory of crime.</p>

<p>But these scenes no human being can ever describe. It would require a
pen of adamant and the heart of a fiend to depict a single act of that
fearful outbreak.</p>

<p>All the night, and deep into the sweet rosiness of the morning the
terrible strife raged on in that doomed city. But in the broad day these
black savages began to retreat from their ghastly orgies, and, for a
time, the delirium of murder waned from its climax. The thirst for
rapine slackened to a degree, and the monsters who had found this
ferocious pastime full of intoxication, grew sluggish like wild beasts
satiated with blood.</p>

<p>Some of these wretches lay down in the public streets, and fell asleep
in the hot sun; others huddled together in torpid masses and sunk into
stupor, dreaming of coming nights, which should give them a new riot of
blood and fire. Stumbling over these, fierce crowds of untired demons
kept on their work, stabbing right and left in brutal wantonness, for a
lack of victims, and sickening the air with boasts of hideous acts
performed in the night, and which another night should witness. Never on
this earth had a scene more revolting presented itself to the beautiful
sunshine.</p>

<p>But human nature is not all vile, and even among those ignorant,
ill-used blacks, germs of compassion, tenderness, and good faith are
found, redeeming, in a degree, the harrowing cruelties of the many.
Among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span> these good men&mdash;good in spite of ignorance and wrong endured&mdash;was
the black man Jube. If ever faithfulness, natural feeling, and a simple
sense of honor, dwelt in a human being, these feelings throve in the
broad, cloudy bosom of the slave, and many another household servant
became a household saviour in that cruel time.</p>

<p>While his little master was wrapped in the deep slumber which follows
exhaustion, the negro had besought permission to go on shore and search
for his master. Captain Mason, in his generous pity of the poor fellow,
sent the boat back to the place it had reached the night before, to lie
in wait for the negro while he searched around the palm trees and the
neighboring chaparral for some traces of the noble master who had won
his whole savage heart by great kindness.</p>

<p>The men who waited in the boat saw him wandering along the shore in a
dejected attitude, for a long time. At last he came near a great
spreading aloe, whose broad under leaves were half buried in the sand.
Those who watched, heard a low, wailing cry, and saw the negro fall upon
his knees, and rock to and fro in an agony of grief over some object
concealed behind the aloe.</p>

<p>"He's found something that's cut him down like grape shot," said one of
the sailors, flinging a quid of tobacco, which he had just cut for
himself, back into his box, and closing it softly.</p>

<p>"Such a scream as that is enough to take a man off his tobacco for a
month," answered another tar, taking off his tarpaulin, and wiping his
bald head with the sleeve of his jacket.</p>

<p>"Supposen we pull in and see what it is?" said Rice.</p>

<p>"No; the captain told us not to go ashore. Some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span> them tarnal niggers
'ed get hold of the boat, spite of us," answered the old tar.</p>

<p>"But we'll row up into shallow water, and one of us can go see what's
the matter, and the rest 'ell take care of the cutter. Every thing seems
to be still along there, not a nigger in sight," answered Rice, who
commanded the boat.</p>

<p>The boat was urged into water so shallow that one of the sailors rolled
up his duck trousers and stepped in, wading easily ashore. With a long,
rolling step he swung himself forward up the beach, and soon found Jube
on his knees by the body of a dead man, who lay in the gaunt shadow of
the aloe, pierced through the heart, with a spear broken short in the
wound.</p>

<p>Jube looked up, his black face wet with tears, his great hands clasped
and pressed downward in the sand.</p>

<p>"It is him. Me has found the master," he said in broken English. "Cold!
cold! oh, so dead!"</p>

<p>The sailor looked down into the calm, aristocratic face of the dead
patrician&mdash;for such the man evidently was&mdash;no marble could ever have
been more finely cut, or coldly pale than those features. But for the
masses of glossy hair and the black eyes, that remained partly open, the
idea of some perfect specimen of sculpture would have been complete.</p>

<p>Jube unclasped his great hands, and with a reverential touch attempted
to close the eyes.</p>

<p>"It's of no sorts of use," said the sailor, "you poor heathen nigger
you. It ain't possible to shut them eyes now; they'll stay wide awake
till the judgment day. All we can do is to dig a trench here, close by
this thing with the notched leaves, and lay him in. Come, bear a hand,
and I'll help you, if you are black; this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span> ain't no time to be
perticular, besides I've kinder took a notion to you, anyhow."</p>

<p>Jube did not comprehend many of the words, but he understood the
gestures, and went to work, raining great tears on the sand as he
scraped it up.</p>

<p>The sailor fell to, and worked vigorously, comforting the negro, in his
rough way, all the time. At last a trench of some depth was dug, and the
sailor bade Jube help him lift the body into its poor resting-place.
Then Jube began to sob, and tremble through all his massive frame, but
he obeyed meekly. The garments upon the body were rich and of value.
That sailor only got ten dollars a month for his hard labor, but he
never thought of taking a fragment of those rich clothes, nor attempted
to examine the pockets, though a clink of gold, as they lifted the body,
told him that what might have been wealth to him was there. As for Jube,
poor fellow, he scarcely knew what money meant, and if he had, would
have guarded that about his master's person with his life.</p>

<p>So they lifted that proud and noble man from the red sand where he had
been murdered, and laid him in the best grave they had the power to
make. Jube tore away one of the great aloe leaves, and laid it over the
white face, moaning like a wounded creature, as he shut it out from his
own sight; but he shook so violently, that the sailor, with rough
kindness, bade him go away, while he filled in the grave, and evened the
sand. So Jube sat down in the shade of the aloe, and covering his face
with his hands, sat still waiting.</p>

<p>When that boat neared the vessel, Jube saw his young master leaning over
the bulwarks, and watching it with longing impatience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
"Jube, oh, Jube! why did they not come? I thought they would both be
with you!" he cried, in a voice of keen disappointment. "Come up, come
up, and tell me; the time has seemed so long."</p>

<p>Jube climbed up the rope ladder very slowly, with his black face bent
toward the water. At last he stood on the deck, his heavy shoulders
drooping, his eyes cast down, and his great bare feet trembling on the
boards they pressed.</p>

<p>"Jube, Jube! tell me where they are? Why did mamma go away, and not call
me? It wasn't kind, Jube."</p>

<p>"Mistress always kind, very kind, little master," stammered Jube, trying
hard to control the tremulous motion that contracted his heavy lips.</p>

<p>"But where? Is she with papa?"</p>

<p>"Yes, little master. She&mdash;she is with papa, sure."</p>

<p>"Jube, did they both go home and leave me?" questioned the child, with
tears in his eyes. "Did they, Jube?"</p>

<p>"No, little master, they didn't do that; how could they?"</p>

<p>"Well, then, where are they?"</p>

<p>"Not in the old home, be sure, not there; bad slaves, bad negro there."</p>

<p>"But are they safe?"</p>

<p>"Yes; safe."</p>

<p>"On shore?"</p>

<p>"Yes, little master, safe on the shore."</p>

<p>"But when will they come after us, Jube? I do so want to see them. Mamma
was so tired she couldn't say good-night, and papa&mdash;I feel very, very
unhappy about papa; he never left me so long before."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
"But he couldn't help it, little master; sure he couldn't."</p>

<p>"I know that. Of course he couldn't; but, oh! when will he come? Jube,
Jube, my heart aches so!"</p>

<p>"Jube's heart aches, too."</p>

<p>"Does it, Jube, like mine&mdash;heavy, heavy; and when I ask you about them,
it aches worse? Dear old Jube, I won't do it. You shall see how bravely
I can wait."</p>

<p>The child took one of Jube's hard hands in his, as he spoke, and led the
negro away.</p>

<p>"Why, how you shake, Jube! What for? I never felt you shake so before!"
he said, laying his other delicate hand caressingly over that of the
black man's.</p>

<p>"Jube helped row the boat, little master, and it is hard work."</p>

<p>"But you are so strong, Jube; strong as a lion, and as brave; papa said
so."</p>

<p>"Did he say that, little master; did he?"</p>

<p>"There, you are shaking again! Sit down, Jube. Don't be afraid; I won't
ask any thing. There, lean your head against the mast; I will watch for
them while you rest."</p>

<p>"No, don't watch. They won't come yet&mdash;not yet."</p>

<p>"Not before night, perhaps."</p>

<p>Jube closed his eyes heavily, and groaned.</p>

<p>It was mournful&mdash;the sight of that strange child, sitting upon Jube's
knee and watching the shore with a trusting, earnest hope that his
father and mother would seek him over the water where she had fallen
asleep and floated away, but would be sure to come back when papa was
found. The child said this a hundred times, as he patted the hard palm
of the slave with his little hand, while Jube answered bravely, each
time, "Oh, yes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> Master Paul, sometime they shall see us again. That's
what the captain was saying to me just now. I hope it's true, little
master; for your sake I hope he knows."</p>

<p>When he had done speaking, Jube would turn his head quite away, and
shake the tears from his eyes, while the boy fell to his patient watch
again.</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="v" id="v"></a>CHAPTER V.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">THE SEARCH FOR GOLD.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Paul</span> saw that questions wounded his black friend, and fell into silence,
thinking of his parents with mournful yearning, but not mentioning them
again.</p>

<p>It was a long, dreary day; but the sunset came at last, flooding the
harbor with crimson, which made the water look ensanguined like the
land. One by one the lights of the town began to flame out again, and
hoarse sounds mingled with the surf of the tide. Now the boy became
restless, and his eyes began to gleam impatiently.</p>

<p>"Jube, dear Jube, let us go ashore with a big boat, and bring them away!
don't you hear the noise&mdash;don't you see how the fire flashes. They'll be
hurt, Jube, and we shan't be there to help them."</p>

<p>Thrasher, the mate, was passing as the boy said this; he paused, and
patted the little fellow's head.</p>

<p>"Who is it you want to help, my little man?" he said.</p>

<p>The child shrunk against his black guardian, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span> looked up with such
gentle earnestness that Thrasher's eyes fell under the glance.</p>

<p>"We want to go after <i>them</i>, monsieur. My papa and mamma; she couldn't
wait for me, because papa wanted her, and so rowed away after him. But
she sent dear old Jube to stay with me, didn't she Jube?"</p>

<p>He lifted both hands, and pressed the palms lovingly against the black
cheeks of the slave, with a childishness which was the more touching
because of its mournful trust.</p>

<p>"So you think your mother has gone back to the shore again?" said
Thrasher, whose attention to this child was singular, for he was in no
way a man of fine sensibilities, and had received the boy, and,
afterward, the slave, rather grudgingly.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Paul; "after papa lay down to rest, you know, mamma
wanted to go back there, and struggled, and cried; but they wouldn't let
her. You might know she'd be off the minute she woke up and found the
captain had left her with a boat all to herself; but she's a long time.
Don't you think it's a long time. I'm so tired of waiting."</p>

<p>"And who was your mamma, my little man?"</p>

<p>"My mamma! she was a beautiful lady, oh! so beautiful! I know that's
true, because papa told her so every day, when she put the red roses in
her hair that Jube brought. You remember, Jube?"</p>

<p>"Yes, little master, I remember; but turn your eyes away, I can't bear
'em just now."</p>

<p>"And where did your father live?" persisted the mate, feeling his way
adroitly, as a pointer scents his game.</p>

<p>The child pointed toward the town.</p>

<p>"In a large house?" said Thrasher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
"The biggest house on the island," answered Jube, true to the instincts
of his class.</p>

<p>"And they drove your master away like the rest?"</p>

<p>"Like the meanest of them all. It was his own slaves began. They knew of
his gold, and that he wanted to send it off to some other country."</p>

<p>"He was rich, then?"</p>

<p>"Rich&mdash;no man like him in all Domingo! It was a great family&mdash;six
brothers; they all gathered up their gold and brought it to my master's,
ready to be put on board some ship&mdash;this one it may be. I had care of
the gold, but the boxes were heavy, and the other slaves guessed what
was in them, and told about it. But they did not know where it was hid,
for my master and his brothers only went with me to the cellar. It was a
heavy lift for gentlemen like them, but we got it all into the vault,
and heaped stones and rubbish against the door. They meant to move it
that very night. A boat was ready to carry it to White's Island. The day
before, masters and I went there, and dug a pit to bury it in."</p>

<p>"And did you take it there?" asked the mate, with suppressed eagerness.</p>

<p>"No, surely&mdash;no!" answered the slave, with a sudden gleam of caution.
"The patriots fell upon us&mdash;they began to burn and kill without warning.
My master sent me to the boat, and told me to wait till he came with the
mistress; but they fired the wharves, which made the water one blaze of
light; and I could not come near the shore, try as I would. So at last I
went to the island, and waited; but instead of my master&mdash;oh! you know
what came there!"</p>

<p>"But the gold&mdash;did any one find the gold?"</p>

<p>"How do I know?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
"And the house&mdash;was it burned?"</p>

<p>"No; little master says they were dancing, and shouting, and drinking
wine from the cellars when the family was driven out."</p>

<p>"And your master, where is he&mdash;his brothers, what became of them?"
questioned the mate, so excited that his voice grew hoarse.</p>

<p>"Hush," said Jube, glancing at the boy.</p>

<p>"All?" whispered Thrasher.</p>

<p>"All, master."</p>

<p>"Where did you say the house stood?"</p>

<p>"Yonder, on the edge of the town; you can see its white walls in the
sunset behind the mango trees."</p>

<p>"What, that house? I know it, I have passed its gardens a hundred
times."</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall never pass them again," said Jube, with tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh yes; papa will come after us, don't say that, Jube," whispered the
boy.</p>

<p>The mate, who had taken so much interest in them both, now turned
abruptly away, and began to pace the deck, with the quick, heavy tread
of a man who thinks excitedly. At last he paused, stood looking over the
bulwarks awhile, and then went below.</p>

<p>The captain was in his cabin when the mate entered rather abruptly.</p>

<p>"Captain Mason," he said, "you had the luck to do some good on shore
last night, what if I take a turn with three or four of the men? The
black rascals will be at their work again, no doubt."</p>

<p>The captain looked up surprised. It was the first instance of humanity
he had ever known in his mate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
"Go by all means," he said; "pick your men and God speed you!"</p>

<p>Thrasher did not start so promptly as his eagerness seemed to promise.
He was a long time lowering the boat, and paused more than once to
cross-question the slave and the little boy, always managing to gain
some fresh knowledge with every innocent answer he received.</p>

<p>At last, after the night had set fairly in, he descended to the boat,
followed by four stout men, selected from the crew. The boy watched his
movements with anxious eyes, and Jube seemed troubled as the boat glided
off into the twilight.</p>

<p>They reached the shore, Thrasher and his crew, without molestation; a
broken attempt at riot had been made early in the evening, but the
blacks were besotted with a carousal of blood which had now lasted
forty-eight hours, and fell into sluggish inactivity; so the band of
sailors, always popular men with the blacks, made their way safely
enough up to the walls of the white villa, which Jube had pointed out
from the ship. It was a vast pile, built low on the ground, but covering
a spacious area, and enclosing a court, overrun with flowers, that
filled the air with fragrance, trampled and torn as they had been.</p>

<p>It was one vast scene of desolation. The broad gates were flung open,
the trees that overhung them were broken, and their branches trailed on
the ground; while a host of rude feet had trampled the luscious fruit
upon the pavement of the court. Among the roses, and passion-flowers,
and cape-jessamines that trailed along the court, a fountain flung up
jets of pure water; but its basin of white marble was clouded with broad
crimson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span> stains, that all the crystal springs on earth would never wash
out. Over the arched entrances that led to the separate apartments of
the house, lamps of colored glass were swinging exactly as they had been
lighted when the family were surprised by the murderers, fleeing from
them only to meet a more terrible fate outside the walls. No one had
cared to put the lamps out, so they burned on through the daytime, and
into this second gloomy night.</p>

<p>The mate and his men stood a moment in the court, not to breathe its
delicious atmosphere, but to take their bearings, as he said, with
unseemly spirit. Lights burned in a few of the windows, and he saw by
the gossamer draperies, and silken gleam within&mdash;for the latter shone
richly through a lattice-work of flowers which filled the verandas&mdash;that
he was near that wing of the vast building usually occupied by the
family, now utterly dispersed, save one little child and a single slave.</p>

<p>"From these rooms there should be some passage leading to the cellars,"
reasoned the mate, as he mounted a flight of marble stairs that led to
the first gallery, and was followed by his men, whose heavy footsteps
broke the bell-like fall of the fountain with their coarse noise.</p>

<p>The work of desolation was complete in those vast saloons. The broad
silken divans were trampled over by the tracks of naked feet, left on
the delicate fabric in long trails of soot. Chandeliers of frosted
silver, and lamps of delicate alabaster, were torn down and overturned,
with their wax candles, broken and trampled upon the floor, and perfumed
oil dripping along the pure marble. Many of the lace window-curtains
were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span> torn to shreds; others were gathered up and twisted in soiled
wisps over the cornices; some still floated in gossamer softness over
the windows, through which orange branches, heavy with bloom and golden
with fruit, looked in, rustling to the night wind with sweet, lulling
sounds.</p>

<p>The men passed through these saloons, trampling many a precious thing
under their feet, which a delicate feminine taste had gathered to
beautify the dwelling. They rushed through the broad saloons, and into
the more private apartments&mdash;apartments in themselves so pure and
spotless, that the insurgents had turned from them, as fiends might be
supposed to shrink away from the resting-place of angels. The couches
were untouched, and white as snow; flowers stood, but half withered, on
the marble consoles; a few ornaments, dropped on the floor, bespoke some
haste, but no violence. One of the sailors crushed a string of pearls
under his foot, and ground it to powder upon the marble floor. Another
tangled his boot in a web of costly lace, that had been hastily taken
from a drawer and dropped in the terror of a sudden assault. The man
tore it away from his boot with a smothered growl, and the party went
on, looking cautiously back to be sure that no one followed.</p>

<p>The mate had guessed well. He found a passage leading from one of the
lower galleries into the cellar, which was now half flooded with wine
that had been left to flow from the reeking casks without check. Here
the blacks had held a grand carouse after the massacre under the palm
trees. Bottles had been dashed against the walls, and the fragments were
trodden into the earth, which sent up mingled fumes of wines and
liquors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span> with a strength that almost stifled even those tough sailors.</p>

<p>Plashing across the moist floor till his boots were red with wine, the
mate found a pile of rubbish heaped against the wall. He held up a
little silver lamp, which had burned its perfumed oil long after the
fair hand was cold that filled it, and bade the men go to work. He spoke
in a hoarse whisper, that almost startled himself.</p>

<p>The bricks and loose stones flew right and left, revealing a low iron
door. The foremost man swung the crowbar over his head to dash the door
in, but that instant Thrasher seized him by the arm. The man turned
angrily around. Then, struck by the dead whiteness of Thrasher's face,
glanced over his shoulder, and the iron fell heavily from his grasp.</p>

<h2><a name="vi" id="vi"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">THE FLOGGING.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">They</span> were far out to sea, the New England brig which lay in the harbor
of Port au Prince on that terrible night, with the unhappy and helpless
creatures who had found protection under its flag. Thrasher, who was the
commander now, sat in his cabin at breakfast. He held a cup of coffee in
one hand which seemed to have excited his disfavor, for setting it on
the table and dashing the spoon so angrily into the coffee that it
scattered the drops all around, he called out,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
"Come here, you brat."</p>

<p>Paul, the little boy whom Captain Mason had saved, came reluctantly
forward, his black eyes heavy with fear, and his delicate limbs
trembling, as you see those of an Italian greyhound when driven into the
cold.</p>

<p>"Why don't you move&mdash;what do you stand there shaking like a thief for?"</p>

<p>These coarse words were made even more brutal by the base French in
which they were uttered. At any time the boy could with difficulty have
understood them; in his fright he could only stand still, with his
terror stricken face turned away from the man who persecuted him.</p>

<p>"Why don't you move, I say?" repeated the commander.</p>

<p>"What for, monsieur&mdash;what shall I do?" asked the child.</p>

<p>"What shall you do?" answered the man, mimicking the gentle terror in
the child's voice with a rough drawl of mockery. "What shall you do? why
go to Jube, your father, and tell him to come here this instant! I'll
teach him to send coffee like that to a gentleman's table. Bah, it's
bitter as gall and thick as mud. Go call your father, I say."</p>

<p>"My father!" said the boy&mdash;"my father!" and his beautiful eyes were
instantly flooded with tears.</p>

<p>"Yes, that nigger, Jube."</p>

<p>"But Jube is our slave, not my father."</p>

<p>"What! don't let me hear you tell that again or I'll give you a taste of
the cat-o-nine-tails, no humbug with me, now I tell you."</p>

<p>The boy shrank back, but gleams of fire shot through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> the tears that
still trembled in his eyes; he felt that the man was insulting him, but
did not quite comprehend how.</p>

<p>"Go call your father, I say," repeated his tormentor.</p>

<p>"I'll call Jube if you want me to," said Paul, with the dignity of a
little prince, "but if I were to call ever so long my father&mdash;oh, my
father!&mdash;will never, never come."</p>

<p>The pale face of the child burned red as he began to speak, but it was
pallid again before he closed, and his proud voice broke into sobs.</p>

<p>"Take that, and mind how you howl when I speak to you again," cried the
tyrant, giving that pale cheek a blow with the palm of his hand.</p>

<p>The little fellow staggered back and uttered a faint cry, but in an
instant the dignity of blood aroused itself even in that childish heart.
He stood up bravely, pride of race sparkling through his tears.</p>

<p>"I am not a slave, and you have struck me."</p>

<p>The mate laughed.</p>

<p>"Well done, my little bantam rooster, give us another fling."</p>

<p>The boy's face flamed red under the insulting laugh.</p>

<p>"I am only a little boy; besides, papa says gentlemen never fight with
their fists, so if I were a man it would be all the same&mdash;but Jube can
fight like you&mdash;he knows how&mdash;yes, I'll call Jube."</p>

<p>"Not till I've knocked all the infernal pride out of your little body,"
exclaimed Thrasher, starting up and making a dash at the boy.</p>

<p>He was too late. The little fellow had cleared the cabin stairs with the
leap of a fawn, and rushing across the deck where Jube was standing,
seized him by the garments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
"Jube, good Jube, you can fight&mdash;that man down-stairs wants you&mdash;he
struck me here on my face, the very spot my mother kissed&mdash;with his
hands so&mdash;he struck me."</p>

<p>There was no need for the boy to say this, for three blood red finger
marks glowed like living fire across his delicate cheek.</p>

<p>The gladiator broke into Jube's eyes as he saw these marks. His hand
clenched and unclenched itself, and he ground his white teeth in
ferocious rage. The savage African was fully aroused in him then.</p>

<p>"Look," he said, towering upward, till his athletic person was revealed
in all its powerful proportions&mdash;"look, your master has struck my
master's son&mdash;I'll kill him!"</p>

<p>"You will, ha!" cried the loud voice of Thrasher, who had followed the
boy on deck. "You will, lump of ebony, will you? Well, let's begin at
once. I say, Rice, take that fellow to the rigging, and give him a
couple of dozen. I'll let him know that white folks have the say here."</p>

<p>Jube did not understand this order, for it was given in English, but he
guessed something of the truth when the group of sailors, that had stood
looking on, broke up in a commotion, and two of the strongest came
toward him menacingly.</p>

<p>"What is it, tell me&mdash;what are you going to do with Jube?" inquired the
boy, going up to Rice, who, with all the men who had been trading to St.
Domingo for years, had a rude knowledge of French.</p>

<p>"Go away, shaver, get down below, nobody wants to hurt you, and if they
did I wouldn't let 'em by jingo!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span> but the nigger there, mutinied, and
he'll have to catch it."</p>

<p>"Don't, don't hurt Jube," cried the boy in an agony of fear, "what has
he done?"</p>

<p>"He's threatened the captain&mdash;that is, he's threatened the one who took
the captain's place, and that 'ere's mutiny on the high seas, do you
understand?"</p>

<p>The sailor put Paul aside as he gave the desired information, and joined
his comrade who had seized upon Jube, who inquired fiercely what they
wanted with him.</p>

<p>"Don't stand to talk, but lash the nigger up, and give him an extra
dozen for his impudence!" shouted the captain; "no parley, but go to
work."</p>

<p>While Jube stood half at bay, doubtful of the evil that threatened him,
the two sailors sprang upon him, and began to take off his outer
garments, while half a dozen others stood ready to aid them, should the
poor fellow resist. There was a desperate struggle, but it lasted only a
few moments; great as Jube's strength was, it proved nothing opposed to
the powerful force arrayed against him. In a few moments the poor fellow
stood with his bare shoulders glistening in the sunshine, and all his
muscles quivering with the fierce restraint that had been put upon them.
Each hand was manacled by the iron gripe of his captors, who were stern
but not mocking, while Thrasher, who looked on with a cold smile,
muttered:</p>

<p>"Yes, my fine fellow, we'll teach you the difference between this deck
and Port au Prince&mdash;here white folks are white folks."</p>

<p>Paul stood looking on, wild with terror. "What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span> were they doing? Would
they kill Jube before his eyes? Had he been the cause of this?"</p>

<p>The men dragged Jube away, heedless of his broken cries. With them a
punishment at the rigging was no very extraordinary occasion, and when
exercised on a negro was not altogether a disagreeable excitement. But
Rice, more merciful than the rest, came back, and attempted to persuade
the child away from the deck, but Thrasher confronted him at the
gangway, and ordered him back.</p>

<p>"Let the youngster stay and see the fun; it'll do him good," he said;
"if he keeps up that whimpering I'll give him a dose, too."</p>

<p>Rice stood a moment with something of revolt in his eyes, but seemed to
think the question not worth a quarrel, and slowly retreated, dragging
the child with him. The mate did not deem it prudent, perhaps, to urge
the seaman too far, so Rice withdrew to the remotest part of the deck,
and lifting the child in his arms, pretended to point out a ship which
he persisted was hovering on the line of the horizon.</p>

<p>But this humane ruse was of no avail. With the little heart quivering in
his bosom like a wounded bird, and every sense awake to the danger of
his friend, Paul was not to be interested in any thing. His white face
was turned anxiously over the sailor's shoulder, and he listened keenly.</p>

<p>It came at last, a sharp, cutting twang. The boy uttered a shriek, and
struggling from the sailor's arms, fell upon the floor, shuddering all
over. Again, again, and again; harder, fiercer, and with a biting
sharpness that made the blood curdle in that young heart, the blows
fell, then a cry, shrill with agony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
The boy leaped to his feet, and breaking away from the kind hold of the
sailor, went staggering across the deck, pale and wild, stung almost to
death with the pain of those lashes.</p>

<p>The captain stood near the masthead, smoking a cigar. He did not lose a
single puff&mdash;nay, between the lashes he would sometimes retain the smoke
with his lips, and emit it enjoyingly, as the blows fell, thus keeping
lazy time with the torture he was inflicting.</p>

<p>Half blind, almost dead, the boy came toward him, and fell at his feet,
clasping his hands and holding them up in dumb, pitiful entreaty, for
the voice was dead within him, and his pale lips uttered moans instead
of words.</p>

<p>"Ha! you have come to, have you?" exclaimed the mate, taking the cigar
from his mouth, and winding a loose fragment of tobacco leaf around it.
"I thought as much. Well, never mind, the music's nearly half over
now&mdash;then your turn shall come."</p>

<p>Those little hands dropped, and the child fell forward on his face; a
faint quiver which followed each crack of the lash was all the sign of
life he gave.</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="vii" id="vii"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">A REBELLIOUS SPIRIT.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> threat of violence which Thrasher uttered against the delicate
creature at his feet, might have been only an ebullition of his dormant
hatred of the boy&mdash;the bitterest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span> and most deadly hatred known to
humanity&mdash;that of a bad man for the object he has wronged; but wanton or
earnest, the threat had its effect, for Rice strode to Thrasher's side,
and bending to his ear, whispered.</p>

<p>"I say, captain, we've had enough of this ere, I reckon. Jest order the
men to unsling that nigger, or I will."</p>

<p>Thrasher took the cigar from his mouth, and held it smoking between his
fingers.</p>

<p>"What's the meaning of this, Rice?" he said, mildly, knocking the loose
ashes away with his little finger, as he eyed the seaman with a keen
side glance.</p>

<p>"What I said afore; we've had enough of flogging for one day, at any
rate."</p>

<p>"I'd do any thing to oblige you, Rice, be sure of that, any thing but
give up my authority before the men."</p>

<p>"The men don't know what I'm saying to you. Anyway, jest give orders for
'em to wait till we understand one another."</p>

<p>The mate lifted his hand, at which signal the man who had just raised
the lash, which was growing red and wet in the sunshine, dropped it
heavily. The thong fell upon the deck, leaving a crimson trail along the
white boards, while its holder stood panting and out of breath from the
violence of his exercise.</p>

<p>"Well now, Rice, what is the meaning of all this?" said the mate, a
little anxiously.</p>

<p>"It don't mean nothing, only this, captin&mdash;I won't have that ere nigger
struck another blow in this child's hearin'. As for the nigger hisself,
I don't care a quid of tobaccer, but human natur' can't stand that
sight&mdash;at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span> any rate, I cant and won't&mdash;so if you expect me to keep a
close jaw, order them to let the nigger down at once."</p>

<p>"Hush&mdash;speak lower, Rice. You see I must keep up my authority. You can
understand that. I'd give the fellow up with pleasure to please you,
Rice; but this is the first punishment on board since I came into the
command."</p>

<p>"Since you came into the command&mdash;jest so."</p>

<p>"And if I give up now, it'll be all day with my authority; and that'll
never do."</p>

<p>"There's something in that ere," answered Rice, with an uneasy hitch of
his garments, "but then there mustn't be no more flogging afore this
little chap, no how. I don't want to be obstroperous neither. Supposing
you shut the fellow up, and keep him on bread and water a few days&mdash;I
shouldn't mind that."</p>

<p>"But, he's a good cook&mdash;we can't spare him, Rice."</p>

<p>"Must," answered the sailor.</p>

<p>"Must," repeated
<a name="the" id="the"></a><ins title="Original has duplicated the">the</ins> mate, with a gleam in his
side glance.</p>

<p>"Must," repeated Rice, settling his garments afresh.</p>

<p>The mate hesitated awhile, eyeing the sailor askance, but Rice stood
solidly on the deck, looking him in the face as if certain of his
answer.</p>

<p>"Very well, pass the order. Remember, I let off a dozen lashes, and give
him irons, with bread and water, in exchange. Make that well
understood."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, never you fear," was the prompt reply.</p>

<p>"As for this imp of Satan," said the mate, spurning the prostrate boy
lightly with his foot, "I'll deal with him."</p>

<p>"Don't do that, Mr. Thrasher; you've struck that ere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> child once too
often. Try it agin, and there ain't a man on board this 'ere brig as
won't rise agin you."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Thrasher, closing his teeth hard, "and you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll head 'em, and take you home in irons."</p>

<p>Thrasher turned a dull white, and, for an instant, a sound as if his
teeth were beginning to chatter, came faintly through his lips, but he
turned it off with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Hang me if I care what you do with the fellow or the boy. I only wish
we had left them behind; that would have settled it once for all."</p>

<p>"But seeing as they're here, I won't stand by and have 'em murdered
outright."</p>

<p>"Well, well, as you like; it won't pay for us to quarrel, Rice."</p>

<p>"Enough said, captain."</p>

<p>"Now I'll go down and finish my breakfast," said Thrasher, tossing the
end of his cigar overboard. "Confounded coffee the fellow sent down;
that was what commenced the row, I believe; but I'll try another cup."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, better go down and leave the rest to me," said Rice, stooping
tenderly over the boy. "Come, get up, my little chap; it's all over! No
use wilting down in this way! poor fellow, poor fellow, how he shakes!"</p>

<p>The child, who had been lying with a hand pressed hard over each ear,
lifted his head, and turned his white face on the seaman.</p>

<p>"Is it over? Have they killed him? Oh! Jube, Jube!"</p>

<p>This pathetic cry reached the unhappy man, who had just been taken down
from his place of torture. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span> his helpless hands hanging loose, and
the red drops falling from his shoulders, he came reeling across the
deck, and lay down by the boy, like a great Newfoundland dog wounded
unto death.</p>

<p>Paul received him with a gush of tears. He took the handkerchief of
delicate cambric from his bosom, where it had rested sacred till then,
for his mother had placed it there, and tenderly wiped the drops of
agony that still hung on Jube's brow. The poor negro, always treated
with gentle household kindness till then, moaned aloud, not with the
pain&mdash;he was brave enough, poor fellow&mdash;but from a sense of the
desolation that had fallen on his master's son.</p>

<p>"Oh, young master, young master, who will help you now when Jube has
only the power of a dog left? never 'till now, never 'till now, was Jube
striped with a whip! What will become of him? He had nothing but his
strength, and they have taken that!"</p>

<p>"Come, come," said Rice, "it isn't all over yet, by a long shot."</p>

<p>The negro looked up with his heavy, bloodshot eyes, in which there was a
gleam of patient heroism that touched the sailor greatly, while the boy
grew faint and gasped for breath.</p>

<p>"Don't, don't," pleaded Rice, patting the boy gently with his rough
hand. "As for you, cuffy, keep a stiff upper lip. I'm to put you in the
hold, and feed you on bread and water; but I'll see that the handcuffs
ain't too tight, and as for the grub, why some of us chaps will go on
half rations to give you a meal now and then."</p>

<p>"I don't care about the place you put me in," said Jube, mournfully, "or
what they feed me on. If they chain me down hands and feet I won't say
one word; but the little master, what will they do with him?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
"Never you mind about that, cuffy; I'll see to him. He shall have enough
to eat, any how."</p>

<p>"But that man&mdash;he'll strike poor little master again, and Jube chained
down in the bottom of the ship."</p>

<p>The great tears rolled over Jube's face as he said this, and he shook
violently.</p>

<p>"No," said Rice, with an honest sailor's oath, which was profane in its
language, but noble in its meaning, "the captain shan't touch him agin,
I give you my hand on it."</p>

<p>Jube took the rough hand in his trembling grasp and kissed it
gratefully.</p>

<p>"Take me down, Mr. Captain, take me down; get out the irons; bring on
the bread and water; you'll see that Jube will wear 'em, and sing like a
bird, so long as you take care of <i>him</i>."</p>

<p>"That's hearty now," cried Rice, pleased to the depth of his really kind
heart. "Just give up, and it'll be all the easier. I've had the
bracelets on in my puppy days, over and agin. It aint nothing."</p>

<p>"I'm ready," answered Jube, making a brave effort to smile, and
staggering to his feet, where he stood shaking all over from the shock
of pain that had been given to his whole system. "I'm ready. Good-by,
little master."</p>

<p>Paul set up on the deck, and lifted his hands pitifully, while his
pale, cramped features began to quiver with coming tears.</p>

<p>"Botheration, 'taint nothing. I'll smuggle the little craft down to see
you every day, if not oftener. Do you hear that, shaver?"</p>

<p>Tears swelled into the boy's eyes, and he covered them with his hands,
moaning painfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Rice was a good deal troubled that his efforts at consolation had so
little effect, but all at once his face brightened, and thrusting a hand
deep into the pocket of his trowsers, he brought forth a huge jackknife,
and opened it temptingly.</p>

<p>"Look a here, little whipper-snapper, just look a here, no doubt about
it, I'm a going to give you this very identical knife, I am, sure as a
gun."</p>

<p>The boy took his hands away, and gazed wonderingly at the great,
buck-horn handle, and the hooked blade, to which tiny fragments of plug
tobacco clung lovingly.</p>

<p>"All right," he said, closing the blade with a jerk. "I thought you'd be
surprised. Isn't it a sneezer? Where's your pocket?"</p>

<p>As Rice thrust the knife into the silken lined pocket of Paul's dress,
the boy looked downward with vague interest; but, all at once, his face
brightened. He snatched at the knife eagerly, and tried to open it.</p>

<p>"It's rather stiff, I reckon, for them little fingers," said Rice,
opening the knife again; "but, never you mind, I'll drop a little lamp
ile on the jint, and it'll open easy as whistling, it will."</p>

<p>"Is it strong-is it sharp?" cried the boy, touching the hooked blade
with his delicate fingers. "Would it kill a man?"</p>

<p>"Why, Lord love yer eyes, yes! Jest turn the pint upwards, and it'd rip
its way like blazes. But what der ye ask that for?"</p>

<p>"Jube," said the boy, in sad, earnest tones, holding up the knife, "if
he strikes me again, and you are by, just take this and kill me at his
feet. I'd rather die a thousand times than live to see you whipped for
my sake."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
"Give it to me," said Jube, with a gleam of his old African ferocity.
"I'll use it, but not on you, little master&mdash;not on you!"</p>

<p>"Look a here," said Rice, hitching about uneasily in his clothes. "You
jest let the boy's knife alone, will ye? I guv it to him for a
plaything, and it's hisen, not yourn. Do ye want to be slung up again?
Here comes the captin&mdash;now up with ye, for I must be cross as blazes, or
he'll think we're confabulating something against him. Come, look sharp,
nigger, I can't wait here all day for you to snivel over a flogging as
you ought to be grateful for, 'cause you arned it." To this Rice added,
in a low tone: "Look scared, as if I had been a worrying you tooth and
nail, or he won't trust you with me." Then raising his voice, he went on
abusing poor Jube, till the mate came forward with a smile upon his
face.</p>

<p>"That's right, my good fellow, take him down. He'll be an example for
the men. They're beginning to want one. Off with him&mdash;plenty of irons,
and don't be too particular about the bread or the water either."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, I'll see to him," cried Rice, ferociously. "Come, march,
tramp&mdash;off with you, cuffy! You never seed sich a pair of bracelets as
I've got for ye down below."</p>

<p>Jube kept his eyes bent to the deck, that no one might mark the
ferocious hate that burned in them&mdash;hate that re-strung his nerves, and
made them tough as iron.</p>

<p>"You'll learn to threaten me!" said the captain, scoffing at the negro,
as he passed.</p>

<p>Jube did not lift his eyes, but passed on. Paul arose and followed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
"Hallo! what is the youngster after?" cried Thrasher.</p>

<p>"I want to go with Jube," said the boy, shuddering under the captain's
eye.</p>

<p>"You want to go with Jube, ha!" cried the mate, mocking the gentle
tones, which might have won pity from a Nero. "Well, you won't go with
Jube, do you hear that? I aint likely to give up cook and cabin-boy,
too, so just march for the caboose."</p>

<p>Rice turned back, leaving Jube near the gangway. "Look a here, captain,"
he said, in a low voice. "Don't put upon that little shaver so! It's too
bad; he's a peaked child, just out of his mother's lap, and this ere
sort of work will kill him sure as a gun."</p>

<p>"Well, if it does, Rice, what's the loss?"</p>

<p>"Wal, it'd be a good deal to me, anyhow. I've sort a took a shine to the
boy."</p>

<p>"That's unfortunate," sneered the mate, "because I, being commander
here, have just done the other thing."</p>

<p>"Hate him like pison&mdash;I knowed it from the first."</p>

<p>"Well, what of it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;only as I've took a notion to him, and he kinder likes me,
supposing you jest give in a trifle, and let the chap alone. I shall be
much obleeged to you if you will."</p>

<p>Thrasher turned on his heel, saying, with assumed carelessness, for he
did not like the gleam of those gray eyes, "Well, well, we'll talk about
that another time."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye," responded the sailor, with a nod of the head, which had a
meaning in it that Thrasher did not like.</p>

<br />
<span class="sub">THE BOX OF JEWELS.</span></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I'll</span> have an end of this," said Thrasher, as he went into the cabin
restless and anxious. Throwing himself on the locker, he began muttering
to himself. "As for keeping this child to hang around my neck like a
millstone, I never will. He's old enough to remember every thing; and if
the negro tells tales he'll be sure to cherish them. What possesses Rice
to rise up against me in this way? If he'd been quiet, I'd have had 'em
both under water before half the voyage was over."</p>

<p>Thrasher lay awhile revolving these thoughts in his mind, without
arriving at any satisfactory conclusion. At last, a new anxiety seized
upon him; he started up, and went to the closet set into the wall, in
which he had seen Captain Mason secure the box of jewels that Jube had
placed in his keeping.</p>

<p>"It's fortunate I secured this," he muttered, taking a key from his vest
pocket, and fitting it into the lock. "He didn't know I was on the
watch, careful as he was. Ha, it's all here! and that nigger knows it as
well as I do. He'll tell, and then Rice'll take another hitch in the
eternal rope that's being knotted around me. I would give any thing to
know exactly what the fellow is at, but I won't ask questions, that's
against my principles; they let out too much."</p>

<p>As he spoke, Thrasher sat down, placed the bronze box on his knee, and
forced the lid open. Just as we have seen them before, the jewels lay
huddled together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span> without cushions or caskets; but, here and there, a
fragment of crimson or white satin clung to them as if they had been
torn away from their cases in wild haste.</p>

<p>"Now, I dare say, this is worth lots of money, if one only knew about
it," he said, taking up a necklace, formed in links of large, oblong
opals, with rainbows breaking in fragments from their hearts, and
rivulets of diamonds running around them. "How it glitters! This would
be pretty for <i>her</i>. I wonder if she'd take it from me now? or warn me
off as she did that evening? Well, I don't know about that&mdash;a poor
wretch, with nothing but his good looks, and so on, to recommend him, is
another thing from a fellow that can come to a woman with both hands
full of yellow gold and such things as this. Wouldn't they blaze on that
white neck!&mdash;such a neck, with shoulders that dimple like a baby's hand!
I saw them once when she was dressed to go out with him. She little
thought I was under the window, and that a corner of the paper curtain
was turned up, just leaving a peep-hole. How softly the white dress was
folded over her bosom. Lord, how my heart went down as she put on that
lace cape, and fastened it with a wild rose that he had given her before
my very face! No wonder I hated him! there isn't a man on earth that
could have helped it. Handsome&mdash;was he really handsomer than I? did she
love him so very much? Oh, how it blazes! These are real diamonds, no
mistake about that. How the light rains from them! Oh, how I'd like to
see it flashing on her neck, just as it was then, with two or three of
these things in her yellow curls. Women like these gew-gaws; and she's
fond of pretty things&mdash;like a child about them; besides, she'll be poor
enough before I get home, she and the child&mdash;his child."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
He crushed the necklace in his hand, as the image of a pretty, fair
haired baby girl rose before him, and crowded it fiercely down into the
box. "She'd be wanting some of them for her, I dare say. Well, perhaps
that woman could do any thing with me; in fact, when I first knew her,
any kind woman, from my mother down, would mould me as she liked, I was
wax then; but after she married him&mdash;well, it's no use thinking what one
has been, or how much better things might have turned out; there's iron
enough in me now. Still, I loved her then well enough to go mad and run
away from all that ever cared for me. I might have been a gentleman; the
old folks educated me well enough for that or any thing else, but she
drove me out before the mast. Storms and hardships was what I wanted; I
got enough of it in the end. It made me tough and hard as the rocks we
sometimes narrowly escaped. Cruel, too&mdash;every one says that&mdash;but I could
be kind to her and the little girl, perhaps, if the mother loved me. If
not, oh, how I should hate the blue-eyed imp."</p>

<p>These thoughts seemed to excite the man beyond anything that persons
knowing his stern character would have believed. His hands clutched and
unclutched themselves in the jewels, his lips quivered, and alternate
gleams of fire and clouds of mist chased each other in his eyes. He
started up, thrust the box back to its closet, forgetting the fears that
had urged him to seek for it, and putting the key back into his pocket
went on deck. The first sharp gust of wind that swept his face carried
off these feverish thoughts and he grew hard as rock again.</p>

<p>Paul was on deck, crouching down among the barrels and bales of
merchandise that offered him friendly concealment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span> Wretched and
heart-broken, the child watched for Rice. When he saw Thrasher, fear
made him shrink together and hold his breath as if some wild beast were
creeping along his path. After a little, the mate went down again and
Rice appeared.</p>

<p>The boy crept from his hiding-place and came up to the sailor.</p>

<p>"What have you done with him? please tell me."</p>

<p>"Oh, here you are, as large as life," said Rice, who had missed Paul
from the deck, and felt some relief at finding him alone and so quiet.
"Done with him? why cleared out a snug harbor in the hold, and anchored
him safe and sound. Come along, if you want to see."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes, I want it so much. Is it dark?"</p>

<p>"Rayther, I should think."</p>

<p>"May I hold your hand?"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, come along afore the captain knocks us all aback."</p>

<p>"Who goes there," cried out a voice from the cabin stairs.</p>

<p>"Nobody but Rice and this 'ere little shaver," answered Rice, facing
round to meet Thrasher.</p>

<p>"Where are you taking him?"</p>

<p>"Nowhere just now&mdash;he wants to take a look out."</p>

<p>"Very well&mdash;pass on."</p>

<p>Thrasher went down to the cabin again; he had seen Rice as he led the
boy across the deck, and understood the opposition which was going on to
his wishes. The train of thought that had seized him while examining the
jewels had not entirely passed away, but with it came others appealing
to his worst passions, and mingling themselves, as evil things sometimes
will, with much that was tender and pure in the man's nature. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
not all bad&mdash;what human being is?&mdash;but he was a strong man, and used his
evil strength without scruple to secure the love, which was, in truth,
wounding him daily with its hungry cries.</p>

<p>Thrasher was afraid of Rice, and with him fear was an incentive to
action. Jube and the boy Paul were also sources of great anxiety. They
might interfere with his one great hope, and utterly destroy the
brilliant future that lay so temptingly before him. All this was food
for thought, and made him more than usually morose.</p>

<p>The sensitive nature of the boy Paul had suffered acutely by the
indignity that had been put upon him, and still more by the awful scene
of Jube's punishment. But there was a noble spirit in that little frame,
and though he shrank from encountering his enemy, it was not from a
cowardly feeling, but as a brave man may evade a wild beast that
possesses a hundred-fold of his own physical powers. No amount of
punishment would have induced the child to submit meanly; but he was a
creature of exquisite refinement, and had, all his little life, been
shielded from the first approach of sorrow. Within the last few weeks,
he had been cast headlong into the boiling vortex of the most terrible
scenes that ever disgraced humanity&mdash;scenes that drove many a stout man
insane, and left a whole population at the mercy of savage, maddened
slaves. He, a young, sensitive child, brought up in luxury, shielded
from the very breath of a flower if it was not grateful to his fine
sense&mdash;loved by his parents&mdash;idolized by a host of servants&mdash;had
struggled through death, and horrors sharper than death, to find himself
worse off a thousand times on board that brig, than any of his father's
slaves had ever been.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
And now his only friend was torn away, and cast into the black depths of
the hold, smarting with pain, writhing under the ignominy of a first
blow, and chained hand and foot like a mad dog. If little Paul had known
that the captain would kill him, I think he might have found his way to
that poor friend.</p>

<p>At last they were together, down in the black hollows of the ship, with
scarcely a breath of air, and surrounded by a host of uncouth objects,
which appalled them like the walls of a prison. They had no light, and
the rush and gurgle of the waves sounded horribly distinct. Jube held up
bravely after his little master came to bear him company. No groan
escaped his lips, but he insisted on sitting up, and made Paul nestle
close to him, striving to soothe and comfort the child, spite of his own
keen suffering.</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="ix" id="ix"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">CHAINED IN THE HOLD.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Chained</span> in the hold, drifting away&mdash;it was only after dark that Paul
could visit his friend without fear of detection. On the third night,
they were together in the hold. Thrasher himself had been down just
before, and finding Jube without irons, had riveted them on his limbs
with his own hands, so the poor fellow was bowed down with the weight of
his chains, and could not even hold the child to his bosom when he came
to share his solitude.</p>

<p>It was very dark, and Paul was compelled to feel his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span> way through the
freight heaped up on each side the place where Jube was confined.</p>

<p>"Jube, Jube! do you hear?" he called out, in a frightened voice.</p>

<p>Jube lay still, for he was afraid of frightening the boy by the clank of
his chains, but he called out softly, "Yes, little master, here I am,
just here, don't hurt yourself against the boxes."</p>

<p>"Can't you come and help me, Jube; it's dark as midnight."</p>

<p>"Well, little master, it ain't just convenient this minute; but if
you'll listen while I talk, and come by the sound, it'll bring you right
straight to Jube."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes, I hear; keep speaking, Jube, but not too loud. What a noise
the water makes to-night, and the ship pitches so I can hardly stand.
Oh, here you are, dear Jube; just hold out your hands, to steady me.
What's that?"</p>

<p>"Only the handcuffs; but don't you mind, they don't amount to much after
all&mdash;screwed a little tight&mdash;but not unpleasant, if it wasn't for that."</p>

<p>"Chained you&mdash;chained you!" said the boy, in a voice of such keen
anguish that Jube forced a little, hoarse laugh, in order to convince
him that being chained hand and foot, in the black hold of a vessel, was
rather a refreshing amusement than otherwise. "Why, it ain't nothing,
little master, just see here!"</p>

<p>He tried to lift his hands, but the iron galled his wrists, and forced a
groan from his brave heart.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jube, Jube, they will murder you!"</p>

<p>"Not they&mdash;why it's nothing."</p>

<p>"Let me help you hold the irons up, they drag on your poor hands&mdash;there,
does that make them lighter?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
"A good deal, little master; every thing is light when you come to see
Jube."</p>

<p>The gentle boy had knelt down in the darkness, and was striving to hold
up the chains that dragged in rusty links from the poor fellow's hands.</p>

<p>"Are you hungry, Jube?"</p>

<p>"No, not at all, little master; had a splendid dinner just now."</p>

<p>The poor fellow had just eaten half a cake of hard sea bread soaked in
water.</p>

<p>"Because I've saved my dinner," said the child, "and we'll eat it
together."</p>

<p>"Oh, little master, there never was but one angel like you that ever I
saw."</p>

<p>"Mamma!" said Paul, softly, "you mean her, I know."</p>

<p>"Yes; who else?"</p>

<p>"I shall never be beautiful and kind like her, Jube&mdash;never! but, when
she finds us, you will tell her how I have tried to be good and patient,
Jube?"</p>

<p>"Yes, little master."</p>

<p>"How mournfully you say that. Are you crying, Jube?"</p>

<p>"Crying? no, no; don't you hear how I laugh?"</p>

<p>"That's worse yet; the chains are breaking your heart, Jube."</p>

<p>"No, I like 'em; they're a sort of company."</p>

<p>"Company!"</p>

<p>"Yes; when I'm all alone in the daytime, you know, I can jingle tunes
with 'em."</p>

<p>"It's awful music, Jube; my heart trembles when I hear it. Besides, I
cannot get close to you, the iron keeps me off."</p>

<p>"Just creep up to this side, little master, and lean against my
shoulder; the feel of you gives me heart."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Paul crept close to his friend, and passed one arm over his chest as his
cheek rested on the shoulder turned lovingly for its reception.</p>

<p>"How the water beats and roars," said Paul, clinging close to his
friend; "it sounds like that night."</p>

<p>"Yes, I've been listening to it all day; sometimes it seems close, too,
as if it would leap in and tear me to pieces; but that is when you are
not here."</p>

<p>"How it moans, Jube!"</p>

<p>"Don't tremble, little master, it's only the water, and that isn't cruel
like men."</p>

<p>"Hallo, here, havn't you a voice, cuffy? Here's some prog, and I've
brought something to rig up a light that you can see to eat by."</p>

<p>It was Rice, with a tin basin in his hand half full of lard, in which a
twist of cotton lay coiled like a serpent.</p>

<p>"There, just wait till I set this down shipshape, and you shall see what
I've got; some boiled beef and lashings of grog; havn't wet my whistle
to-day. Hallo, cuffy, what's this&mdash;a cargo of iron on board!&mdash;who did
that ere?"</p>

<p>"<i>He</i> did it," said Jube, while Paul lifted his head; with hope in his
eyes.</p>

<p>"<i>He</i> did it, did he!" Here the sailor emitted half a dozen heavy oaths,
in broad English, which neither the boy nor Jube understood. "Just give
us hold here; if I don't smash every link on 'em afore ten minutes is
over, call me a land lubber that's afraid of his mammy. Hold out them
hands, blackball. By jingo! can't do it without a hammer. Yes, this'll
do; smash, here it goes! You like that music, my little commodore, does
ye? Now out with yer feet, blackball, and when the captain comes, tell
him I did it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Jube, who had been painfully cramped for hours, stood up and stretched
himself, as the irons fell with a clank to his feet.</p>

<p>"It seems kind o' refreshing, I reckon," said Rice, bringing one keg
forward, on which he placed his light, and another which was to serve as
a table. "Where's that jackknife, whipper-snapper? Out with it, and cut
up the grub. Set to, cuffy. Glory! how the ship rolls and pitches! We'll
have work afore morning. The fellow will crowd all sail; he'll fetch the
brig into the middle of next week at this rate. Never mind; set to, all
hands, we may as well go to Davy Jones' locker with a full cargo on the
stomach as with empty lockers."</p>

<p>Jube was nearly famished, notwithstanding his boasted dinner, and he
accepted this hearty invitation with zest. Paul tasted a few mouthfuls
of the food, but with strange hesitation, as if he were putting some
restraint on his appetite. His own little store of provisions remained
untasted, and he made no effort to bring it forth.</p>

<p>"Why don't you stow away?" asked Rice, cutting a lump of beef in two and
splicing it, as he observed, to a piece of bread. "What are you afeared
of?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'd like to save a little, if you please," said Paul, timidly.</p>

<p>"Save a little! why, what's the use? There's plenty on board; I can get
a double allowance any time."</p>

<p>"You can, and will you?" cried the boy, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, but what for?"</p>

<p>"We may want it, who knows? The captain may forbid you to come here, and
then Jube would starve."</p>

<p>"Well, that's sensible. It ain't likely to happen, but then there's no
harm in a full locker. I'll bring down a bag of bread this minute if
he's in the cabin&mdash;then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span> there's plenty of oranges in the cargo; if you
come to hunger, cuffy, you can stave in a box, and hide the boards. Now
fall to, youngster. There's no fear of a famine."</p>

<p>The boy was very hungry, but it made him faint, rather than eager.
Something seemed to excite him; perhaps it was the gathering storm,
through which the brig labored heavily. Perhaps he had some vague,
childish hope, scarcely understood by himself; certainly his eyes had
never shone so brightly before. His face was that of a young hero
preparing for battle.</p>

<p>The brig plunged and reeled more and more. Her timbers began to strain
and creak; the waves leaped and howled against her sides like charges of
cavalry in fierce action. The roar and boom of the storm was terrible.</p>

<p>The two men who sat together in the dim light, floating upon the basin
near by, looked at each other. The negro's face was ashen gray; the
sailor lost his ruddy color; but the boy's eyes grew bright as stars.</p>

<p>"It's on us&mdash;it's on us&mdash;and every stitch of canvas out!" cried Rice. "I
knew he was acting like a fool, but didn't expect this. Splurge! heave!
Crack&mdash;crack! Jerusalem! there goes the mainsail! Aye, aye."</p>

<p>The hoarse call of a trumpet rang through every corner of the brig.</p>

<p>"All hands on deck!"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye!" shouted Rice, kindling to his work; "keep a stiff upper lip,
cuffy, and cheer the boy, for we are just as near Davy's Locker as any
of us ever will be again!"</p>

<p>They saw him plunge onward through the reeling freight, and he was gone.
The poor negro and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span> child were left alone, not quite in darkness,
for the cotton wick still shimmered fitfully, and made the blackness
beyond its little pale circle more dismal than ever. It seemed just
enough of light to see each other perish by, and that was all.</p>

<p>Louder and fiercer grew the storm. The brig was tossed upon it like a
handful of drift wood; every timber seemed to carry on a struggle by
itself&mdash;every joint wrenched and tore against its fastenings. The
strained rudder shrieked like a wild animal in the agonies of death. The
hoarse cry of the trumpet sounded like a groan through the general
turmoil. But all these sounds were nothing to the howl of the winds, and
the great upheaving rout of the waters, as they swelled and mingled
together in one tremendous uproar. The negro fell upon his knees,
trembling and ashen; but the boy&mdash;the gentle, sensitive child&mdash;stood up,
with a smile on his mouth and a beautiful brightness in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid!" he said, bending over the negro. "The God that took
care of my mamma when she fell asleep, is here. Something tells me so."</p>

<p>The poor negro had no God of his own people to understand, so he hung
upon the words that fell from those young lips with unreasoning trust.
The dusky color came back to his cheek, and lifting his faithful eyes
upward, he said meekly:</p>

<p>"If you say so, young master, I believe it. Jube go where you go; she'll
be sure to want him, too."</p>

<p>A fierce plunge&mdash;a recoil&mdash;and the brig stood still, shivering in all
her timbers, like a wild horse with its fore feet over a precipice. It
was but an instant. Then a cataract of waters swept over her. She rolled
upon her side, and could not right herself; a mighty throe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span> and she
struggled back, working heavily. Another plunge&mdash;a crash&mdash;a despairing
cry from overhead&mdash;and the boy started from his wrapt composure.</p>

<p>"Come, Jube, let us go up and tell them not to be afraid."</p>

<p>The crew had given up. One man, Rice, stood at the helm, resolute to
meet death at his post when it came. Thrasher stood firmly, with the
trumpet grasped in his right hand; but his face was like marble, and he
gave no orders. The brig that he commanded was almost a wreck. The sails
had been swept away; the mainmast was in splinters; not a vestige of her
massive bulwarks was left. The men were grouped together in sullen
despair. Nothing was to be done&mdash;they could only stand still and wait.
With that tornado tearing through the mighty waters, and lashing them
into great sheets of angry foam, there was no contending. They huddled
together, that group of stout men, helpless as infants.</p>

<p>When despair was on every face, and the storm raged fiercest, that pale,
Heaven-eyed boy, came up through the hatches, and stood among the
sailors, smiling. He did not speak, but the sweet serenity of his face
gave them courage.</p>

<p>The mainmast had fallen, dragging heavily on the ship. The last order of
the mate had been to cut it away, but no one obeyed, and thus inevitable
destruction lay before them.</p>

<p>"One more onset, my men!" cried Rice. "Clear away the mast and she will
right herself."</p>

<p>"Jube, give me an axe, I will help!" cried Paul; and the beautiful
courage that shone in his face inspired the men. They fell to work
vigorously. The mast, with all its entanglement of cordage, plunged into
the boiling sea, and the brig righted herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
The storm was over, the dismantled brig still rode the waves, for the
staunch timber of New England does not yield readily, and the strongest
had been put to its test in that gallant craft. Jube was sent back to
his imprisonment in the hold, where Paul sought him at every
opportunity; but, from the night of the tempest, a strange animation had
marked the boy, something which no one could understand.</p>

<p>"Jube," he said, having left the deck on the third night, when the sea
was calm as if it had never known a tempest, and ten thousand stars
broke their flickering gold on its waves. "Jube, it is time that we look
for mamma. God has taken care of her, I know, but we must search and
find her."</p>

<p>"Little master, I know where she is, we left her on White Island."</p>

<p>"And you did not tell me when I was so near; but we cannot be far off
now, the storm drove us back. Jube, I've been watching for something to
happen, for it is sure mamma wants us. Look behind that barrel, and see
how much bread I've saved. Then the oranges Rice spoke of; he broke open
a box, and I've got plenty."</p>

<p>"Well, little master."</p>

<p>"They've been working on the side of the ship to-day, and did not haul
up the boat. That was what I've been watching for. Take the bread and
the oranges, Jube, and let us go."</p>

<p>Jube arose, took up the little sack which the boy pointed out, and
followed his young master without a question. They crossed the deck
softly, dropped down the side of the vessel unseen, and with the knife
which Rice had given him, Paul cut the boat loose from the ship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
The brig lay motionless, for she was still disabled, and the boat rocked
lightly on the waves, breaking the starlight into golden ripples; thus
the boat and the half wrecked vessel drifted apart. Three days of
sunshine, and calm, lonely, bright days, in which these two childlike
beings floated like people in a dream. The boy was in search of his lost
parents, and looked out for them over the bright ocean with smiling and
beautiful faith. The slave hoped nothing, sought for nothing. He was
content by his young master's side. They had no compass, and but one
pair of oars, which proved of little use, for the boat had no
destination, nor its inmates the remotest knowledge of their own
reckoning. Thus they drifted on three days without accident. No vessel
hove in sight, and all was a clear, heavy calm. On the fourth day the
bread and fruit were gone. Not a mouthful of food, not a drop of water,
save the great deep, a draught of which would be delirium or death. The
fifth day, and the pangs of hunger had crept steadily on, and gnawed at
their vitals relentlessly. Paul no longer gazed abroad on the waters,
but lay faint and ill in the bottom of the boat, looking up to the stars
in the night time, as if missing his mother on earth, he sought her
there. Thus they drifted on day and night, until the end drew near. Jube
managed to catch a little dew at sunset, which he gave to the child.
Rain fell once in small quantities, and refreshed them, but still the
cry of famished nature went up for food, and there was nothing but the
salt water and the rainless heavens to answer it.</p>

<p>Paul lay in the bottom of the boat, fading away, and moaning with the
pangs of famine; Jube bent over him, breaking the hot rays of the sun
from the white and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span> sunken face with his body, for they had no other
shelter. The boy moaned in his sleep, and called for his mother in
feeble anguish. Jube was very weak, but he managed to lift that light
weight so far as to lay the boy's head on his knee.</p>

<p>With a spasm of pain the child awoke.</p>

<p>"Little master."</p>

<p>Jube's voice was like that of an old man, hollow and broken. The boy
looked up, tried to smile, and murmured,</p>

<p>"Yes, Jube."</p>

<p>"Would you like something to eat, little master?"</p>

<p>"To eat&mdash;to eat," whispered the boy, opening his eyes wildly.</p>

<p>"A piece of nice steak. You wouldn't mind its being cooked, would you?"</p>

<p>"Steak!&mdash;something to eat! Oh, Jube, we shall never eat again!"</p>

<p>"Look here, little master, now be still and hear what I say."</p>

<p>The boy made a struggle to collect his faculties.</p>

<p>"Little master, listen: when you find me lying here in the boat, and you
can't feel my heart beat when you lay your hand here, just cut a slice
out of my shoulder with the jackknife."</p>

<p>The boy closed his eyes, shuddering.</p>

<p>"It won't be very hard eating."</p>

<p>The slave was feeling for the knife as he tempted the famished child,
who lay moaning across his knee. He found it at last; but his gaunt
hands opened it with difficulty, for their strength was all gone.</p>

<p>The poor fellow felt for the spot where his heart beat strongest. Then
he spoke to the child again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
"The knife will be open, little master, don't forget what I tell you."</p>

<p>He lifted the knife feebly, a flash of sunshine on the blade gleamed
across the half shut eyes of the boy. He comprehended the meaning of
Jube's words. He sprang up, snatched the knife, flung it into the ocean,
and fell senseless on the bottom of the boat.</p>

<p>Jube burst into childish tears, and with his head bent down to his
breast, fell into a state of apathy.</p>

<p>When he looked up again a ship was in sight, coming gallantly toward
them. He gave a feeble shout, and strove to arouse the child, but could
not. Then he took the cotton bag that had held their bread, and
fastening it to an oar, swung it wearily to and fro, crying out with all
his strength, which left nothing but moans on his parched lips.</p>

<p>The ship bore down upon them, she came so near that Jube could see her
crew on the deck, then veered slowly and faded away.</p>

<h2><a name="x" id="x"></a>CHAPTER X.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">THE HOUSE IN THE PINE WOODS.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> four or five miles from that lovely spot, where the Housatonic and
Naugatuc join their waters, stands a large manufacturing village of no
inconsiderable importance. Iron foundries, paper-mills, India rubber and
silk manufactories cluster around one of the finest waterfalls of New
England. That waterfall is picturesque even now, spite of the cottages,
boarding houses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span> hotels, railroad station, and tanneries, that have
taken the place of green woods, richly clothed hills, and a valley so
fragrant with wild flowers, that it was happiness to breathe its very
air.</p>

<p>But it is hardly worth while to describe this town as it is. Every
thing, even the name, derived from an old Revolutionary officer, is
changed. My object carries me back to a time when it was indeed one of
the loveliest spots in the world&mdash;a rich, deep valley, with a noble
waterfall thundering at its heart. High, curving, and broken banks,
almost mountainous in places, looming up or sloping back on either side,
and two lovely brooks pouring their bright, fresh waters into the river
above the falls.</p>

<p>One came winding around Rock Rimmond, softened and shadowed by its grim
heights. The other, pretty, sparkling Bladens Brook, ran laughing and
dancing through the Wintergreen woods, on the opposite shore, with a
gush of cheerfulness that seemed like sunshine, and leaped into the
river just where it began to gather up its waters for a plunge over the
great falls, in one broad, rushing cataract of crystal. From the falls
downward, the valley was choked up with noble forest trees, through
which the river ran slowly and grandly till it swept around the shadowy
base of Castle Rock, and disappeared on its way to join the Housatonic.
This rock, high, precipitous, and picturesque, terminates all that we
have to do with the valley, for its high cliffs cut off the prospect in
that direction, and all the level space between it and the falls was one
vast grove of white pines, which formed the grandest masses of trees I
ever saw in my life.</p>

<p>A few hemlocks, a white poplar or so, with now and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span> then a magnificent
oak variegated the woods, but great pines predominated everywhere. The
earth was littered with their sharp leaves; the wind sighed among their
branches as if it never could win a free passage through their
greenness. As for the sunshine, it only reached the forest turf and
velvet moss in a golden embroidery&mdash;seldom with broad gleams. Never were
there such cool, green shadows as hung about those woods. The noises
that floated through them were strangely bewildering; there was the roar
and dash of the falls&mdash;the clatter of machinery&mdash;for even in that day
one factory, among the first ever established in New England, stood by
the falls, and the sound of flying shuttles and the beat of heavy looms,
held a cheerful rivalry with the flow of the waters and the rush of the
winds. Then came the bird songs, wild, clear, and ringing, lost outside
of the woods, but making heavenly music if you but listened under the
trees.</p>

<p>Just below the falls, so near as almost to be sprinkled with the spray,
and to gather foam wreaths about its timbers, was a long, low, wooden
bridge, linking two villages together.</p>

<p>These villages crowned the two lofty banks overlooking the falls, from
which one took its name. Fall's Hill was rendered most conspicuous by a
pretty, white church, with a tall, symmetrical spire, cutting sharply
against the sky, added to a cluster of superior dwelling houses, and a
country store. In front of this store, just on the fork of the roads,
stands, I hope to this day, a magnificent old willow tree, under which
people who came from afar sometimes tied their horses, while they went
up to worship in the church, which stood on the very highest point of
land to be found till you came to Rock Rimmond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span> on one hand, or Castle
Rock on the other. These crossroads cut in two directions, one led to
the Bungy hills, and the other toward a red school-house and some
straggling dwellings in shrub oaks: beyond this, the geography of the
country is lost in a confusion of green hills and woodlands, which form
a pleasant and prosperous farming country.</p>

<p>From Shrub Oak, the turnpike leads directly down Fall's Hill with
precipitous steepness, across the old bridge, and through a sand hill,
with a wall of white sand thirty feet high on either side, directly into
Chewstown, on the opposite hill.</p>

<p>This cluster of houses took its name from some old Indian, forgotten by
his tribe, who lived and died in a hut somewhere in the neighborhood,
and at this day is probably forgotten in a town where a change of
time-honored names seems to be a political fashion. At any rate, it was
called Chewstown then, and a smart, active little village it was. For it
had two crossroad taverns, a great, barnlike Presbyterian meeting-house,
and a dashing, new Academy, which boasted of a pretentious little cupola
with a bell in it, mounted on the highest point of land that side of the
river, and contrasting itself saucily with the spire of the church on
the opposite bank. Any number of roads crossed and recrossed over the
hill at Chewstown. There was the Derby road, running along the banks of
the river; the New Haven road, cutting through the sand banks in a
parallel line, and crossroads from the farming districts intersecting
them both. The fact is, Fall's Hill had a little more than its share of
the aristocracy. Chewstown made up for that, by broader commercial
opportunities. The taverns were always in a flourishing condition, and
a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span> blacksmith's shop, that looked like a foundry, brought the farmers
from far and near to get their horses and oxen shod. Besides, there was
a country store on the corner, and three white cottages with basements,
built in a line like city houses, and the farmers on that side of the
river were often heard to say that Chewstown could pull an even yoke
with Fall's Hill any time of day, if they had not got a steeple to their
meeting-house.</p>

<p>In this village, Captain Mason had left his wife and child, and here,
also, Thrasher, the mate, was born. Down in the outskirts of the pine
woods, on the Fall's Hill side of the Naugatuc, a river road ran along
the curving base of the hill, and wound seaward with the stream. On this
road, between the bridge and Castle Rock, there was but one house, a
low, white cottage, with peach trees behind it, and lilac bushes in
front. A great tulip tree sheltered the low roof, and behind the garden
rolled the green billows of the pine woods. It was a lonely, but very
beautiful spot, such as a man like Mason would be likely to select as a
home for his beloved ones.</p>

<p>Here, in fact, this good man had left his wife and only child, the
latter a charming little golden-haired creature of four years old, when
he sailed for St. Domingo in the brig Floyd, which we know to have been
left disabled and drifting on the ocean. The vessel had been absent six
weeks beyond its time, and no intelligence had yet reached her owners or
that anxious woman, regarding her fate. This voyage had been Mason's
first experience as captain; his little savings had been invested in a
private venture, out of which he hoped to provide something&mdash;beforehand,
to use his own words&mdash;for his wife and little one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Mrs. Mason was both sad and anxious&mdash;sad from the gloom of hope
deferred, and anxious because the little provision made for her support
had melted away, leaving her almost in want. She was sitting in her neat
parlor, with one of the little girl's garments in her hands, sighing
heavily with each drawing of the thread, when a knock sounded at the
door.</p>

<p>She stopped, with the needle half through her work, and listened. Of
course, <i>he</i> would never have paused to knock at his own door, but then,
the very thought of this wild possibility suspended her breath.</p>

<p>Again the knock sounded, and the young wife called out with her usual
hospitable voice,</p>

<p>"Come in."</p>

<p>The door opened, and a female entered, wrapped in a dark red cloak&mdash;the
hood of which she put modestly back, revealing as fair a face as you
often look upon in an entire lifetime.</p>

<h2><a name="xi" id="xi"></a>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">KATHARINE ALLEN'S VISIT TO THE WHITE COTTAGE.</span></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Oh,</span> Katharine Allen, is that you?" said Mrs. Mason, with a touch of
disappointment in her voice, which the girl noticed with a pang.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Mason, I had got through my day's work, and so ran down once
more to see if&mdash;if you had heard any thing yet."</p>

<p>"Yes, I thought so&mdash;it must be a comfort to have some one to run to&mdash;I
haven't a living soul!" said Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span> Mason, a little petulantly, for
Katharine had been at the house more than once to ask these same
questions, and the young wife always shrank from acknowledging that she
had no good news. This feeling became more and more painful as the time
wore on, and her own heart grew faint with apprehension.</p>

<p>"Not a word? Haven't you heard any thing?" faltered the young girl,
sinking into a chair, and turning her great blue eyes on Mrs. Mason,
with an intensity of suffering that startled the unhappy woman into a
momentary forgetfulness of her own anxieties.</p>

<p>"No, Katharine, not one word. It breaks my heart to own it, but not a
breath of news has reached me since the brig sailed."</p>

<p>"And she ought to have been in weeks ago! What can be the matter, Mrs.
Mason? tell me, oh do tell me, if you have the least idea!"</p>

<p>"I can only guess like yourself, Kate. The ocean is a treacherous thing
to trust those you love with. The storm of a single night may have made
little Rose an orphan."</p>

<p>The poor woman began to cry as she said this, and calling the little
girl to her knee kissed her with mournful tenderness.</p>

<p>"How fond you are of the little girl&mdash;it must be a great comfort to have
his child looking into your face! One could endure almost any thing for
that!" said Katharine, evidently trembling as she spoke.</p>

<p>"A comfort and a pain, Katharine, for if he never comes back&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't&mdash;don't say that," cried the girl, shivering. "The thought is
enough to kill one: words&mdash;I could not put that into words."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
"I wish you would not take on so," said Mrs. Mason, sharply. "It's bad
enough to wait and wait, and&mdash;oh dear, oh dear, what will become of us?"</p>

<p>Here the poor woman burst into a flood of tears, wringing her hands
passionately.</p>

<p>"Mother," said little Rose, "are you crying because pa hasn't come back
with my pretty dress?"</p>

<p>The mother could not answer for her sobs; as for Kate Allen, she sat
looking at them with cold tears dropping down her white cheeks, as if
she longed to fall upon her knees and ask them to pity her a little.</p>

<p>"What do you cry for, Katy Allen?" said the child, rather jealous that
any other one should weep but her mother. "You have not got no pa, nor
no husband out to sea."</p>

<p>"Oh, God help me! God forgive me! I haven't, I haven't," sobbed the
beautiful girl, rocking to and fro on her chair.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mason checked her tears and looked on wonderingly. This strange
outburst of grief almost irritated her, for, like her child, she rather
craved a monopoly of suffering. All at once a wild apprehension seized
upon her. What if Kate had heard&mdash;what if she knew that the brig had
gone down with every soul on board, and had no strength to speak it out!
Frightened by this new dread she started up and stood over the weeping
girl.</p>

<p>"Tell me&mdash;tell me all you have heard," she almost shrieked. "If you
don't want to see me drop dead at your feet, before the face of my
child, speak out!"</p>

<p>Katharine looked up; amazement checked her tears, and the pupils of her
beautiful eyes dilated.</p>

<p>"I have nothing to say, Mrs. Mason; I have not heard a syllable, how
could I?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
"And are you so very sorry for us?"</p>

<p>"Does it make you angry, because I can't keep back the tears? Oh, it
seems as if I could die, if any one would feel for me."</p>

<p>"Why, Katharine, what is your trouble?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;nothing&mdash;I'm not in trouble."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mason began to look serious, an old suspicion flashed across her
mind. She was not a woman of much natural refinement, and the innate
vanity of her nature more than compassion spoke out in her next words.</p>

<p>"Katharine, speak out&mdash;is it about Nelson Thrasher you are taking on
so?"</p>

<p>The blood rushed over that white face like a sudden sunset, then the
poor girl grew pale again, and purplish shadows came out under her eyes,
leaving them, oh, how mournful.</p>

<p>"You need not look so frightened, Kate&mdash;there's no harm in it if you do
love him, only you haven't got my spirit, that's all."</p>

<p>"What!&mdash;what do you mean, Mrs. Mason?"</p>

<p>"What do I mean? why nothing worth mentioning." A peculiar curve of the
handsome lip, as Mrs. Mason said this, made the young girl shiver from
head to foot.</p>

<p>"Yes, but you have a meaning when you speak of my not having a spirit.
Oh, tell me what it is!"</p>

<p>"Why nothing, Kate, only I thought you would have more pride than to
take up with another woman's leavings."</p>

<p>"Another woman's leavings!" repeated Kate, all aghast; "another woman's
leavings!"</p>

<p>"That was what I observed," answered Mrs. Mason, with a slight toss of
the head. "Boasting isn't in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span> line, or I could point out a certain
person who gave Nelse Thrasher his walking papers more than once, as if
I would condescend to him, when his superior stood hat in hand."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you&mdash;was it so? when, when?"</p>

<p>"Really, Miss Allen, you take away one's breath; of course it was before
I married John Mason, as if there could be a choice."</p>

<p>The poor girl was thunderstruck&mdash;that beautiful face drooped slowly to
her bosom, and she seemed to be shrinking into a shadow. At last, she
lifted her head with a wan smile.</p>

<p>"That was four long years ago, more than four years ago," she
cried&mdash;"Four years ago."</p>

<p>"Well, what of that; four years does not destroy the truth."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," said Katharine, very quietly, "there's some
mistake."</p>

<p>"Mistake! what does the girl mean? as if I didn't know when a man
persecutes me with his love. Makes me a point blank offer, and goes off
to sea in despair when I marry his superior. Mistake, indeed!"</p>

<p>"No," persisted the girl, "I don't believe it; no woman could refuse him
if he once offered. No woman on earth; it isn't in nature."</p>

<p>"Indeed, you have a mighty high opinion of Nelse Thrasher, as if he was
fit to be mentioned in the same day with Captain Mason. I wonder at your
daring to say these things to me."</p>

<p>Katharine did not hear her; she was searching the past, urged and goaded
in her memory by keen pangs of distrust.</p>

<p>"Besides," she exclaimed, "he has been home since then, and never come
near you, not even as a friend."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
"I'd like to see him have the impudence," was the angry rejoinder.</p>

<p>Katharine seemed bewildered a moment, and then clasped her hands in
passionate despair. "What's the use&mdash;oh, what's the use of saying this!
It's terrible, and they both in the deep, deep sea."</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Mason's vanity broke down, and her true womanliness asserted
itself.</p>

<p>"God forgive us for quarreling about them," she said, really penitent.
"If they only come back, I shall be as glad for your sake as you will be
for mine. Don't mind what I said, Katy, it isn't worth remembering. Tell
me now, are you really engaged to Thrasher?"</p>

<p>"Yes." This little word came faltering through lips as cold and white as
snow.</p>

<p>"And you never told of it?"</p>

<p>"What did I say&mdash;engaged! No, we are not engaged. How could I tell you
so!"</p>

<p>"Well, well, there's no harm in it if you are. God send the Floyd and
all hands safely back."</p>

<p>Those large eyes were lifted&mdash;oh! how pleadingly&mdash;to heaven, and then
Katharine began to gather her cloak more closely around her.</p>

<p>"You're not going!" said Mrs. Mason, ashamed of her unwomanly outbreak.
"Just take off your cloak, and have a cup of tea. Rose and I haven't had
ours yet; I fell to thinking over my work, and forgot it."</p>

<p>"No," said Katharine, more quietly, "I must go now; mother will be
anxious to hear. You forget, Mrs. Mason, that my half-brother is on
board the brig."</p>

<p>"Well, true enough, my head was so full of that fellow, Thrasher, that I
forgot that it might be some other person you were crying about. It's
hard, waiting and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span> waiting in this way; but we must have patience, I
suppose."</p>

<p>"I'll go now," said the girl, rising.</p>

<p>Little Rose, with the sweet instinct of childhood, came up to where the
young girl stood, and lifted up her arms for a kiss.</p>

<p>Katharine bent down, with a flutter of the heart, and left a kiss on the
little rosebud of a mouth, but her lips quivered, and the child grew sad
under the mournful caress.</p>

<p>When Katharine Allen was gone, Mrs. Mason sat down to her work again.
She was a vain, self-sufficient woman, but not in reality an unkind one.
The distress which she had just witnessed left her in low spirits. She
was naturally of a hopeful disposition, and, in truth, was quite
incapable of the deep feeling which had disturbed her in Katharine.
Something would turn up and set all things right, she was sure of that;
contrary winds, heavy freight&mdash;there was some such reason why the brig
did not come to port; what was the use of fretting while these chances
remained. As these consoling thoughts passed through her mind, she plied
her needle with increasing diligence. Rose must have her new frock
embroidered before her father came home. A few more leaves in the vine
that enriched the skirt, and it would be completed. Mrs. Mason was
almost out of bread, or any thing from which bread is made, but she was
a woman to cover unsuitable garments with useless embroidery, rather
than turn her hand to any thing by which her necessities could be
supplied. She would rather have seen little Rose hungry a thousand times
than ill dressed.</p>

<br />
<span class="sub">HOME FROM SEA.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">While</span> Mrs. Mason sat plying her needle, little Rose wandered about the
room, wondering what made pretty Katharine Allen so very sorrowful, but
keeping the thoughts to herself. In the stillness, she heard a step on
the gravel walk outside the house. Then a white lilac bush near the
window was disturbed, and she saw a man's face close to the glass. The
child would have cried out, but the tongue clove to her mouth, and she
stood transfixed with fear. She saw the door softly opened, and a
strange man step to the threshold. Then her voice broke forth, and
pointing her finger at the stranger, she cried out:</p>

<p>"Mother, mother! it's somebody from the sea!" Mrs. Mason dropped both
hands in her lap, and gazed breathlessly on the man. Every tint of color
left her handsome face; she tried to speak, but could not. The man was
so pale and so wild of countenance that she might well have been
stricken with deadly fear.</p>

<p>"Nelson Thrasher," she faltered at last.</p>

<p>He took a step into the room, but did not speak.</p>

<p>"Nelson Thrasher!" she almost shrieked. "If you are a living soul,
speak. Where is my husband?"</p>

<p>The man recoiled a step, and well he might. The question came on him so
suddenly, it might have startled the boldest man on earth. It absolutely
seemed to terrify him. He stood a moment staring at her, then answered
in a low, hoarse voice:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
"I come to tell you about him."</p>

<p>The little girl caught the meaning of his words, rose up and seizing his
hand between both her dimpled palms cried out:</p>

<p>"He comes to tell about pa! Oh, please sir, where is he? Why don't he
come home?"</p>

<p>Thrasher looked down in her face, and met the glance of those eyes&mdash;her
father's eyes. He instantly shook her hands off as if they had been
vipers, and with a gesture which seemed to cast aside some terrible
feeling, threw himself on a chair.</p>

<p>"My husband!" said Mrs. Mason. "Tell me, is he coming?&mdash;is he well?"</p>

<p>"Your husband, John Mason, is dead!"</p>

<p>"Dead! dead!" The poor woman grew faint under the suddenness of this
solemn announcement, and dropped helplessly into her chair.</p>

<p>Thrasher sprang up, and stretching out his arms, received her head on
his bosom.</p>

<p>Little Rose stood in silent fear, watching them. After a moment she went
close to Thrasher, and pulled at his coat.</p>

<p>"Let me hold mother&mdash;I don't want you there."</p>

<p>Thrasher pushed her away with one hand. The woman lay as if she were
dead against his heart, which beat with iron heaviness, like the
trip-hammer of a foundry.</p>

<p>Again the child pulled at his skirts. She was crying now.</p>

<p>"What is dead? I say, man, what is dead? I want to know!"</p>

<p>"See!" answered Thrasher, lifting the woman's white face from his bosom.
"See!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
"And is that it?" whispered the child, through her hushed tears.
"Mother! mother!"</p>

<p>The shock and suddenness of Thrasher's tidings had overcome Mrs. Mason,
but she was not entirely unconscious. When the child called out in her
sweet, pathetic voice, she staggered from Thrasher's hold, and falling
back into her chair, held out both arms for Rose. The little thing
sprang to her lap with a cry of joy, and instantly covered the troubled
face with kisses.</p>

<p>"Now," she said, turning her face toward Thrasher; "now tell me about
him, my dear, dear pa."</p>

<p>"Send the child away, while I tell you," said Thrasher.</p>

<p>Rose clung to her mother's neck.</p>

<p>"No," said Mrs. Mason, "she must learn all sometime, and I am stronger
with her near."</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence, then Mrs. Mason said very faintly,</p>

<p>"Was the ship lost?"</p>

<p>"Almost&mdash;but it was not then it happened. We were on shore at Port au
Prince. The blacks had risen, and a horrid murder of the white
inhabitants was going on. Mason would go on shore. I warned him, but it
was of no use. One night, when the massacre was at the highest, he took
all hands except one or two, and left the ship. The negroes were hard at
work, murdering and burning like demons. He <i>would</i> venture among them.
It was dangerous&mdash;I told him so. Well he came back at last with a woman
and little boy."</p>

<p>"A woman!"</p>

<p>"Yes, a beautiful woman, one of the handsomest you ever saw."</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>"He had saved her from a swarm of blacks, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span> brought her and her
son out for a carouse, under the palm trees. The boy was brought on
board, but they carried the lady off to one of the little islands in the
harbor. Mason, with some of the men, went down the ship's side at night,
and rowed off with her. After that Mason was never at rest, always going
off on private expeditions. I did not like it, so one night, when he was
determined to go, I insisted on taking a turn on shore myself. To own
the truth, I had a little curiosity to see the house where the lady had
lived, and to be certain that she was not there still. Well, he
consented, and I went.</p>

<p>"It was a splendid house; covered an acre of ground. Such rooms, such
gardens&mdash;I never saw any thing like it. The house was so large that we
could not tell if it was inhabited or not, but while we were wandering
around, a great noise in the lower rooms alarmed us; we hurried through
the long halls down to the underground cellars.</p>

<p>"The negroes had been there before us. Every thing was in confusion; we
waded ankle deep in red wine. The cellar was half full of negroes who
had been wallowing there, and were now fierce with drunkenness. There
was not much light, for the negroes dropped their torches, one by one,
and the lees of the wine put them out. How your husband came there, I do
not know. He must have followed us in one of the small boats. Certain it
is, when I was half down the steps his face was the first I saw; he was
struggling for his life&mdash;a dozen sooty rascals were tearing at him. I
gave the cry and sprang down, cutlass in hand, but before I reached him
it was all over."</p>

<p>"And they killed him? Oh, father of mercies, they killed him, and you
saw it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
"I have told you all."</p>

<p>The child had been growing pale as she listened, not that she quite
understood, but because of the deadly whiteness which settled on her
mother's face, and the hoarse voice of the man who was speaking. Mrs.
Mason sat still. The shock of this wild story left her dumb. Thrasher
cast anxious glances on her face, but if the child looked at him his
eyes fell. At last, the woman found the power of speech:</p>

<p>"He sent no word&mdash;he died without thinking of us!"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell what his thoughts were, or any thing except that we found
him fighting, and saw him fall."</p>

<p>"And who else saw him?"</p>

<p>"No one. My men went into another section of the cellar. The wine was
good, and they were in no hurry to follow me."</p>

<p>"But some one saw him after&mdash;you did not leave the dead body of my
husband to be trampled on by a band of negroes?"</p>

<p>"We could not help it&mdash;the blacks were ten to one."</p>

<p>"But did no one see him but yourself? Did no one try to help him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, one man."</p>

<p>"And who was he?"</p>

<p>"A fellow by the name of Rice."</p>

<p>"What! Katharine Allen's half brother?"</p>

<p>Thrasher turned paler than he had done before that evening. "Her
brother&mdash;I did not know that," he muttered, uneasily.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mason did not heed this; the conviction of her great loss grew more
and more distinct to her mind; all the desolation that must follow the
cruel news of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span> evening crowded upon her. She folded the little girl
close to her heart, and began to weep over her in bitter grief.</p>

<p>"Are you sure that Rice is connected with Katharine Allen?" asked
Thrasher, taking advantage of a pause in her sobs.</p>

<p>"Old Mrs. Allen was married twice," she answered, impatiently, for grief
made her restive. "He was her only son by the first husband. Tell me
where he is; I want to see him. I want to know every word and look of my
poor, poor husband. Where can Rice be found?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; he kept with the ship. I came directly home, fearing to
let any less friendly person tell you the sad news."</p>

<p>"You were very kind," sobbed the poor woman, "very kind; I shall never
forget it."</p>

<p>"I always wished to be kind to you, Ellen," was the almost tender reply.</p>

<p>"I know it, I know it; but he always stood between me and any other
man."</p>

<p>Thrasher arose, and would have approached Mrs. Mason; but Rose clung to
her neck with one arm and waved him away with the other.</p>

<p>"She is my mother&mdash;you shan't touch my mother!" she cried, flashing
angry glances at him through her tears. Thrasher looked upon the child
with mingled hate and fear. It was wonderful how much power those deep
blue eyes, sparkling with a thousand childish emotions, possessed over
the strong man. There was something spirituelle in her loveliness that
impressed him, as if an angel had been reading the record of his life,
and rebuked him with those violet eyes.</p>

<p>Thrasher arose hesitating, and almost timidly; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span> stood expecting Mrs.
Mason to notice the movement; but she was occupied with her grief, and
did not observe him.</p>

<p>"Mother," said little Rose, smiling through her tears, "look up, mother;
the man who makes you cry is going away."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mason wiped her eyes, and strove to appear interested.</p>

<p>"Hush, Rose, hush, he has been very kind to come with this sorrowful
news."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, he's going right off, so don't cry any more."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mason reached forth her hand; she was a tall, fine woman, with
bright eyes, that tears only softened; these eyes full of touching
sorrow were lifted to his. All that was good in the man's nature arose
in response to this look. His hand trembled as it grasped hers. He could
have fallen on his knees and wept over it, so great was the power of
love in a nature that had little else to soften it. But the eyes of the
child followed his movements vigilantly, and he dropped the mother's
hand with a deeply drawn breath.</p>

<p>"Give the gentleman a kiss, my little Rose," whispered the mother,
touched by his humble demeanor.</p>

<p>Rose turned her face squarely upon him and lifted her eyes. He met their
clear glance and dared not kiss her.</p>

<p>"Good-by," he said, standing before them uneasily.</p>

<p>"Good-by," answered Rose, eagerly.</p>

<p>"When you are better&mdash;when you are a little reconciled, Ellen, may I
come again?"</p>

<p>"No, no," shouted Rose, waving her hand, "no, no, no."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
"Be still, Rose, this is naughty. Remember he was your father's friend."</p>

<p>Rose hid her face and began to cry. Thrasher took the mother's hand
again, dropped it, and went away, softened and almost remorseful.</p>

<br />
<span class="sub">THE WAY-SIDE MEETING.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A footpath</span> intersected the highway some few rods below Mrs. Mason's
cottage, and ran off among the hills that lay behind Castle Rock. At
this point, Thrasher paused. He had only reached town that day, and his
first visit had been to the white cottage. Now, he thought of his
parents, who lived on a farm among those hills, and of another person
whose home he must pass in going there.</p>

<p>"I must see her, of course," he said, mentally; "but not at once. I have
no heart for another scene. But the old folks&mdash;that will be all joy&mdash;no
rebukes or entreaties ever came from that quarter. They will be hurt,
too, if I sleep at a tavern, and the homestead so near."</p>

<p>With these affectionate thoughts urging him forward, he turned up the
foot path and walked slowly on, wondering at the tender feelings that
rose and swelled in his heart as he drew near the family home.</p>

<p>You would not have believed that the man who walked so quietly along the
greensward with the moonlight on his face, could have been the same
person who stood on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span> the deck of that brig and superintended the number
of lashes that should be dealt on the back of a human being. Once or
twice, as his glance fell on some familiar object, a sweet brier bush,
perhaps, or a cluster of tall mulleins that had grown by the footpath
since he was a child, his eyes would fill with tears. There was
something holy and homelike in the stillness that made a child of this
cruel man.</p>

<p>The footpath led Thrasher into the Bungy road. He had mounted one hill
and was descending into the valley which lay between it and another,
when he saw some dark object sitting on a pine stump, from which he had
gathered moss years before. His step was smothered on the sward, and the
night wind, which made a rustling sound among the leaves of a
neighboring wood, rendered his approach inaudible.</p>

<p>It was a woman shrouded in a cloak, but the light was so clear that he
could see the outlines of her person, though her face was bent down and
her limbs were drawn together as if she suffered from cold or sorrow.</p>

<p>Thrasher's heart told him at once who the woman was, and the knowledge
made a coward of him. He hesitated, turned to go back, but resumed his
course again, ashamed of so much weakness. The woman's face was bent
down, her hands were locked around her knees, and he could hear the
swell of her sobs as she rocked to and fro, as if the motion gave relief
to some great pain.</p>

<p>Thrasher stood close by the unhappy creature, but she was lost in grief
and did not look up.</p>

<p>"Katharine!"</p>

<p>She started to her feet with a cry that haunted his memory years after,
and stood before him, shaking in all her limbs. Why did she not fling
her arms about his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span> neck as she had done at parting? Why did she shrink
and gather the cloak so timidly around her? Did the shadow of some great
wrong fall upon her with its sundering power?</p>

<p>"Katharine, you know me, but don't seem glad that I have come."</p>

<p>"Not glad&mdash;oh, my heart is dumb with joy! I thought&mdash;I feared that you
were dead, Nelson, and the idea was driving me crazy. I was trying to
pray when you came up."</p>

<p>She stole timidly toward him and held out her hand.</p>

<p>"Is it real&mdash;are you alive and here? Oh how good you are, coming to our
house the first moment to see me, for I know well enough you did want to
see me&mdash;while I was doubting if you would care about me after being away
so long, and wondering what I should do. You are not changed, Nelson;
you love me yet as well&mdash;better than ever."</p>

<p>There was something in the girl's manner that Thrasher did not
understand. She seemed frightened, and shrunk from approaching him. This
was so unlike the childlike affection with which she had hitherto met
him, that he stood looking upon her in surprise, mingled with a little
irritation.</p>

<p>"Why, Katharine, what is the matter? You are so changed&mdash;it may be the
moonlight, but your face seems thinner and less rosy."</p>

<p>She turned her eyes upon him with a wan smile, but did not answer at
once.</p>

<p>"You have changed, perhaps, and found some one you like better."</p>

<p>There was something in his tones that stung her; a hopeful questioning
as if he wished rather than dreaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span> this change. She looked at him
reproachfully, and her blue eyes floated in tears.</p>

<p>"Oh, Nelson!"</p>

<p>The words were uttered in a very low voice, but in their quietness lay
deep pathos. She moved close to his side and laid one hand on his
shoulder, waiting for him to return the caress. He placed his arm
lightly, and it seemed half reluctantly, about her waist. She felt the
chill at her heart.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> are changed!" she said, in a loud, clear voice, that sounded to
his ear like a challenge. "You come here not to meet, but to abandon
me."</p>

<p>Thrasher tightened his arm around her.</p>

<p>"Is this the way I abandon you?" he said.</p>

<p>She withdrew herself quietly from his arms, and fixing her eyes on his
face gave him a long, sorrowful look.</p>

<p>The moonlight lay full on his features. His dark eyes looked into hers;
a smile, half mocking, half pleasant, hung on his lip. He was a tall,
handsome man, and the moonlight refined his face into remarkable beauty.</p>

<p>"Are you trying me, Nelson?" she said, half returning the smile.
"Don't&mdash;don't&mdash;I have trouble enough without that."</p>

<p>"Trouble&mdash;was there ever a girl of your age without it, I wonder? Come,
take my arm, and as we walk along you shall tell me what great
misfortune sent you here crying and rocking yourself like an old woman
turned out of doors."</p>

<p>Katharine tried to laugh and took his arm, leaning on it with that half
caressing, half dependent grace which a woman who loves from her soul
assumes unconsciously. Formerly, when her arm touched his, he had, at a
time like this, taken the willing hands in his clasp, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span> the touch of
Ellen Mason's fingers thrilled his nerves even yet, and Katharine's hand
drooped helplessly over his arm.</p>

<p>"Now tell me what this great, great trouble is?" he said, walking
forward.</p>

<p>"Wait until we get into the shadow of the woods, and I will," she
replied, in a low choked voice.</p>

<p>They walked on in dead silence, entered the shadow of the wood, paused
in the darkest spot, and talked earnestly together. When they came in
the moonlight again, Thrasher looked pale and angry. He walked fast,
sometimes forcing her on beyond her strength, and cutting up the silk
weed and mulleins in his path with fierce dashes of his walking-stick.
Katharine made no resistance, for a cold, dead silence, which shut out
all joy, had fallen on her.</p>

<p>They came to a little brown house, under the shelter of a hill, and half
covered with morning-glories&mdash;a pretty, rustic place in which Katharine
lived alone with her mother. A board fence ran along the front yard,
hedging in some lilac bushes and a huge snowball bush. A flower bed ran
along each side of the walk, from the gate to the door. All this looked
pretty and cool, in its night dew, and Thrasher recognized the familiar
objects with something like a pang.</p>

<p>Katharine withdrew her arm from his at the gate; she tried to speak, and
ask him to go in, for a light shone through one of the windows, and the
old lady was evidently waiting for Katharine to come home before she
went to bed; her lips trembled, but refused to utter the invitation; he
read it in her eyes, however, and shook his head.</p>

<p>"Not to-night&mdash;another time we will talk this over."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
They parted with these words, and Thrasher walked on at a more rapid
pace than he had yet used. Katharine watched him mournfully as he
disappeared, then, with a deep sigh, she entered the house.</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="xiv" id="xiv"></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">THE OLD HOME AND THE OLD PEOPLE.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A little</span> way over the hill from Mrs. Allen's dwelling, stood a low, red
farm house which covered a good deal of ground, and possessed many
pleasant surroundings, such as marked the more thrifty class of farmers
in those days. Rows of stiff, Lombardy poplars stood in lines before the
house, looking more like mammoth umbrellas, verdant in color, and shut
up for the season, than any thing else. Tall, cinnamon roses clambered
up the front, while a whole forest of lilac and snowball bushes cast
their shadows on the rich sward of the door yard. At the back was a fine
apple orchard which filled the air all around with the delicate perfume
of its blossoms in the spring-time, and gave out a rich, fruity odor in
the autumn. A well sweep pencilled its slender shadow along the plantain
leaves that grew rank at the back door, and beyond that, the distant
outlines of a cider-mill could be imperfectly seen through the orchard
boughs.</p>

<p>Every thing seemed natural to the stern man, as he drew near the
homestead. He could not remember a time when the old place did not look
thrifty and comfortable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span> as it appeared then. A few dry branches
bristled here and there among the poplars, speaking of progressive age,
like gray hairs in the head of a strong man, but they were scarcely
perceptible in the moonlight, and Thrasher could see no change since the
years of his boyhood.</p>

<p>The family sitting room was back of the house, and through the windows a
gleam of light shot along the grass. Thrasher passed through the yard,
and, pausing beneath the window, looked in. The paper blind was partly
rolled up, and he thus commanded a view of the entire room.</p>

<p>Two old people sat together on the hearth, where a few embers lay
smouldering. A round, cherry wood stand stood between them, from which
towered a massive brass candlestick, supporting the only light that
burned in the room.</p>

<p>The old lady was knitting. What a sweet, benign expression slept on her
face! How softly the white hair was folded under her cap! The pure,
healthy bloom on her cheek was something wonderful. It made you in love
with the beauty of old age.</p>

<p>The old man was reading aloud; the great family bible lay open before
him, and his deep, reverential voice could be distinctly heard through
the imperfectly closed window. As Thrasher looked, the old man removed
the spectacles from his eyes, and laid them on the page he had been
reading, while he listened smilingly to some observation that his wife
had made, but which, with her lower and softer tones, Thrasher had lost.</p>

<p>"How many times have we read this chapter together, Eunice&mdash;so many that
neither you nor I can remember them; but every reading brings out
something new&mdash;something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span> more holy than we ever found before. Isn't
that your experience?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the old lady, taking a seamstitch with serene precision
as she spoke. "It seems to me, husband, that one never learns really
what is in the Bible till old age comes on. When we were young, I can
remember being so tired when the morning chapter was read, and full of
other thoughts, that I am sorry to remember now. That is the reason I
always had so much charity for our Nelson. Poor child, he never could
sit still through a whole chapter&mdash;boy or man!"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," answered the old man, with a heavy sigh. "I'm a'most
afraid, Eunice, that we neglected to perform our whole duty to the boy
at the start. He was such a bright child, that we wandered off into
ambition and worldly pride where he was concerned. Now, that we are
getting old, and a'most as good as childless, this idea troubles me more
than a little. Maybe, if you and I had been a little more strict with
the boy, he'd have got over them roving notions, and stayed at home."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said the old lady, putting on her glasses to loop up a
stitch, while a shade of trouble came to her face. "It seems to me as if
nothing would ever have kept Nelson on the farm. He was too high strung
for that. But what then? Every body isn't of the same idea, you know;
and if the education we gave our son helped to unsettle him for our way
of life, it fitted him for another. Remember, he went out first mate
this time."</p>

<p>"He's a brave boy, any way," said the old man, kindling with the
subject; "and if the season of grace has not reached his soul yet, we
must only pray the more earnestly."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
"Yes," whispered the mother. "Pray without ceasing, and in every thing
give thanks!"</p>

<p>"If we did not kneel to the throne of grace in his behalf so often as we
might have done in our younger days, we must make up for it now, for our
son will some day make a shining light in the house of the righteous,"
continued the father. "I feel it. I know it, Eunice."</p>

<p>The old lady sighed.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that even now I pray that he may come back to his home,
before I think of his eternal salvation, for that wish is always
uppermost with me."</p>

<p>The old man smiled reprovingly, and shook his head.</p>

<p>"Ah, Eunice!"</p>

<p>"I can't help it," sighed the mother, confessing her weakness, with a
deprecating smile. "He is my only child&mdash;all the precious, earthly
blessing we have. I can't help being proud and fond of him."</p>

<p>"How could you, when I, a strong man&mdash;one that the brethren sometimes
look up to, as all the church members will admit&mdash;can't keep back the
pride of having a son like that. There's no denying it. Nelson is a
young man that must put a temptation of pride into his parents' path. It
seems to me as if I were a stronger man and you a handsomer woman for
having a son like him."</p>

<p>"So honorable, so handsome," murmured the old lady.</p>

<p>"So strong and energetic," responded the father.</p>

<p>"Ah, if he would but come once more to see his old father and mother."</p>

<p>The old lady bent over her knitting, and pretended to search for a false
stitch, but it was only to conceal the tears that swelled tenderly into
her eyes.</p>

<p>Thrasher could bear no more. The man loved his parents, and those soft
tears in his mother's eyes brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span> moisture to his own. How innocent
and childlike the old people were, in comparison with him. Satan, when
looking over the flow'ry walls of Paradise, must have felt as he did,
listening to that household conversation.</p>

<p>The old man took up his glasses again, and began to read. The mother
kept on with her work, listening, with meek faith, to the holy words
that fell from her husband's lips. All at once she started, dropped the
knitting in her lap, and listened.</p>

<p>"It is his step!"</p>

<p>The old man raised his face from the Bible, and listened, also.</p>

<p>"Yes, Eunice, it is!"</p>

<p>The door opened, and their son stood on the threshold&mdash;a strong,
handsome fellow, such as the father had described him. There was no
outcry of joy, no wordy demonstrations; but a tender gladness possessed
the old people. The mother kissed him, almost timidly. There was
something that awed her tenderness in this powerful young man, though he
did tremble in her gentle embrace.</p>

<p>"My son, you are welcome home&mdash;oh, my son!"</p>

<p>There was something hearty and patriarchal in this welcome of the
father. The noble old Christian that forgave his prodigal son must have
spoken much after the same fashion.</p>

<p>They shook hands&mdash;the father and son&mdash;with a firm, lingering clasp,
while the mother looked on, smiling through her tears. With your genuine
New England housemother, hospitality is always the servitor of
affection. The night dew lay heavily on her son's garments. He looked
pale and tired. The mother's heart rose pitifully in her bosom; she
insisted upon raking open the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span> fire, and getting a warm cup of tea; even
went so far as to offer a cider-brandy sling, with toasted crackers
floating on the top.</p>

<p>Thrasher yielded himself to her tender care. It was wonderful how
submissive and grateful that strong-willed man had become under womanly
influences. He declined tea, but accepted the glass of smoking drink
which the mother prepared. Soon the old man took a tumbler, also, and
praised it greatly; for religious men and elders of the church, in those
times, thought it no sin to make themselves comfortable with a glass of
hot drink before bedtime, never dreaming that their limited indulgence
might lead to excess in the coming generation&mdash;excess which even legal
enactments have failed to remedy. Having no fear and no conscientious
scruples on the subject, the old man enjoyed his glass, and filled that
of his son more than once; for, somehow, the color would not come
genially to the young man's face, and after the first glow of his
reception had passed off, he seemed depressed, almost gloomy.</p>

<p>The old lady took her seat again on the patchwork cushion of blue and
red cloth which Thrasher could remember from his childhood, and
attempted to resume her knitting; but the plump little hands trembled so
much that she gave it up, and drawing back into the shadow, had a sweet,
motherly cry all to herself. It was pleasant to hear those two voices
blending together in their talk. It was heaven to know that the whole
family sat on one hearth again. She could not be thankful enough. What
had she done to merit so much happiness at the hands of the Lord.</p>

<p>This pious under-current of feelings mingled with the conversation as it
went on between the two men, leaping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span> rapidly from subject to subject,
as always happens when members of one family have been long separated.
While the mother was wrapped in dreamy thanksgivings, the old man, not
less grateful or affectionate, fell to questioning his son about his
voyage, the fate of the ship, and the terrible scenes which had been
enacted at St. Domingo, while she lay in the harbor of Port au Prince.</p>

<p>Thrasher went into the thrilling details. He was naturally eloquent, and
the intense interest manifested by his parents, made his pictures as
graphic as the reality; but another person might have remarked, though
his parents did not, that he avoided mentioning either his own share or
that of Captain Mason in these exciting events.</p>

<p>"But how long did this last, Nelson? Was the brig kept in harbor all the
time? Some of the neighbors began to fear that she was lost; but your
mother and I hoped and prayed, didn't we, mother?"</p>

<p>The mother smiled on her son, answering:</p>

<p>"Nelson always knows that we hope and pray when he is upon the great
deep."</p>

<p>"But where is the brig now; at her port?" questioned the father, after a
brief pause.</p>

<p>"No, we were compelled to abandon her; one of the most terrible storms I
ever faced on sea or land, took us unprepared. It swept us clean from
stem to stern. Another hour and we should have gone down like a handful
of drift wood&mdash;for days and days we floated on the ocean, no sails, our
masts gone, nothing to rig new ones with. The men were discouraged, some
of them threatening mutiny; for a negro and a little boy that came on
board at Port au Prince, the only creatures that I know of who escaped
the massacre, were missing just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span> after the storm, and the fellows would
believe that I had something to do with it, so they sulked and
threatened until I began to fear for my life. Nothing but our own great
peril prevented them rising.</p>

<p>"At last, the brig sprang a leak, and what with working at the pumps
night and day, hard commons and no drink&mdash;for I staved the casks
in&mdash;they had plenty to do without turning on me. It was enough to put
down any rebellion to hear the water rushing and gurgling into the hold,
faster, a great deal, than all hands could pump it out. So while working
for their own lives, they forgot to take mine."</p>

<p>"Thank God for this great deliverance," said the old man, solemnly.</p>

<p>The son paused an instant, and then went on.</p>

<p>"The water gained on us; we worked desperately, but the brig sunk lower,
and lower, till we had scarcely a hope left."</p>

<p>"Then," whispered the mother "you thought of us, my son."</p>

<p>"Of his God," said the old man, devoutly; "he prayed to God and so found
safety."</p>

<p>Thrasher was no hypocrite; he remembered how different the scene had
proved to any thing his parents imagined, and felt rebuked by their
simplicity.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, I did think of you both with an aching heart. As for
prayers, we sailors have little time for them. But I was telling you of
our condition; it was forlorn enough. The men gave out and refused to
work. Persuasions went for nothing&mdash;threats were of no use. They were
tired out and wanted to die. You have no idea, father, how reckless such
men are."</p>

<p>"No, son; I couldn't imagine it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
"At last, when all was given up, and we had nothing to do but die, a
sail hove in sight."</p>

<p>"Thanks be to God!" ejaculated the old man, lifting his clasped hands,
while tears stole softly down the mother's cheek.</p>

<p>"'Sail O!' That was a shout which filled us with new life. We tore off
our jackets, we searched for fragments of the old sails, our voices rose
in wild, hoarse shouts, that sounded awfully along the waters. At first,
she did not see us, but seemed steering another way. Our despair broke
forth in one mighty shriek! It reached them&mdash;we could see a commotion on
the deck. Breathless with expectation, grouped together like so many
ghosts, we watched her slacken sail, and bear down upon us. Then the
strongest man among us burst into tears! That moment I shall never,
never forget!"</p>

<p>"Not while there is a merciful God to thank!" said the father, shaking
the tears from his cheek as a lion flings dew-drops from his mane. Low
sobs broke from the darkened portion of the room. During her son's
narration the good mother had sunk unconsciously to her knees, and lay
prostrate before her God, trembling with thankfulness.</p>

<p>Thrasher went on:</p>

<p>"We took to the friendly vessel, all but three persons. They would not
leave the wreck. No persuasion could move them. It was a terrible thing,
but the ship sailed away, leaving them to their fate!"</p>

<p>"And who were these men, my boy?"</p>

<p>"Rice, old Mr. Allen's son."</p>

<p>"God help the poor woman."</p>

<p>"With the negro and boy I told you of. They had taken the boat and put
out to sea alone&mdash;after drifting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span> five or six days hither and yon, they
were taken up by the vessel that afterward saved us. They saw the wreck
and came to her in the first boat. When Rice refused to abandon the brig
they sat down by his side, and so we were compelled to leave them."</p>

<p>"And is this all?&mdash;did you never hear of them again?" inquired the
mother, rising to her feet.</p>

<p>"No; we never heard of them after that. They drifted off with the wreck,
and what became of them no one can tell."</p>

<p>"This will be sorrowful news for our neighbor. Husband, I wish some
other person than our son had brought it."</p>

<p>Thrasher arose hastily.</p>

<p>"Good night, mother. Shall I sleep in the old room?"</p>

<p>His voice shook, and he seemed greatly disturbed.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, my son. You are tired out. Go up to your old room."</p>

<h2><a name="xv" id="xv"></a>CHAPTER XV.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">BREAKFAST IN THE OLD HOMESTEAD.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Nelson Thrasher</span> could not sleep under his father's roof. The neat, high
posted bed, with its blue and white coverlet that he had slept under in
boyhood, was so familiar that it seemed to reproach him in its
homeliness for the great change that had fallen on himself. The little
looking-glass over the cherry-wood dressing stand, flashed upon him like
a human eye angry and fierce at the intrusion of a guilty man where an
innocent boy had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span> slept. As his foot touched the rag carpet, worn smooth
by his light tread, years ago, the breath paused on his lips, and the
stern face softened into sadness so deep, that his worst enemy might
have pitied him.</p>

<p>That instant the old man's voice rose solemnly through the stillness of
the night. From the depths of his heart, he was thanking God that his
son had returned. Every word of that prayer rose to the son, rebuking
him to the soul. He fell upon his knees, unconsciously occupying the
very spot on which his first prayer had been learned from his mother's
lips. Bitter repentance swept over him for the minute, and covering his
face with both hands, he cried like a child.</p>

<p>But such feelings could not hold that stern nature long. When the old
man ceased, Thrasher shook the tears from his eyes, and stood up,
turning his face away from the glass, hating that it should reflect the
workings of which he was even then ashamed. It was useless; the familiar
things around him were full of associations that would make themselves
felt. He put out the candle, and got into bed, his eyes filling in the
darkness as he lifted the coverlet.</p>

<p>Still he could not sleep. The dear old objects were all shut out, but
the home feeling was too strong. For that one hour he was almost a good
man.</p>

<p>As he lay in the darkness, a soft tread came on the stairs, and the door
of his room swung open. He knew all about it. The footsteps were his
mother's. How often he had heard them, in childhood, coming up, because
the kind woman fancied that he might be afraid, or ill, or that the
coverlet had slipped from over him. Just as of old, she glided through
the door and close to the bed. He feigned sleep, that she might not
guess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span> how much he had been acting like a child. She stood beside him,
full of motherly tenderness, yearning for a few last words before she
went to rest; but with gentle self-command, waiting for some sign that
he was awake. When she found that his eyes were closed and his breath
came evenly, she bent down and kissed him on the forehead more than
once, whispering his name to herself, as she had done a thousand times
over his cradle.</p>

<p>Still he did not move; the kiss stole like an angel's whisper through
his heart. For the moment, it sanctified him, even in his own eyes. This
did not appear to awake him, and the mother could attempt no more. Still
she lingered, settled his pillow, delicately as a bird smoothes the
plumage of its young, and tucked up the bed, blessing him the while. It
was not chilly, but the action put her in mind of old times, and she
loved it.</p>

<p>At last that gentle mother glided out of the room, and he drew a deep
breath, longing to call her back, confess how far he had gone astray,
and become as a little child again.</p>

<p>The night wore on, and he had not slept a moment. Many thoughts came
crowding over the holy ones that possessed him, and finally overpowered
them. He thought of Mrs. Mason&mdash;his first, his only love&mdash;for this truth
he confessed to himself over and over again, in the stillness of that
night, when the difficulties of his position crowded close upon him. He
thought of Katharine Allen, not with solicitude, such as the poor
creature's fate should have inspired, but bitterly, harshly, for she was
a stumbling-block in his way, an object almost of dislike. Though a
cruel man, Thrasher was not recklessly so to women&mdash;thoughts of his
mother always kept him from that. Still, he almost cursed Katharine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span> in
the struggles of that night, for she stood between him and the great
desire of his life&mdash;John Mason's widow. But for her, he could make a
brief wooing, settle down by his old parents, and without temptations to
evil courses, become a man of power, for he possessed that which enabled
him to accomplish almost every thing, an unlimited control of wealth.
But with this young creature in the way, what could he do but plunge
into schemes that brought sin and peril with them, such as he shrunk
from encountering. Abandon his father and mother&mdash;go off to some unknown
country with the woman of his love&mdash;cast off all duties&mdash;leave that
beautiful girl to die of grief&mdash;could he do that?</p>

<p>Thus the good angels and the evil spirits struggled over that man all
night long. In the morning, neither had the mastery. On ship-board, the
guardian angel would have been driven forth at once; but under his
father's roof, there was something of heaven which would not let the
seraph go.</p>

<p>After daylight the young man fell asleep, weary with thoughts that still
left their shadows on his forehead. The mother came up twice to call
him, but seeing the weariness in his handsome face, went away, holding
her breath, and walking on tiptoe.</p>

<p>At last he came down-stairs, and found the old people, with the table
spread and the breakfast dishes standing on the hearth, patiently
waiting till he should join them.</p>

<p>It was of no use struggling. Over a breakfast table like that the good
angels held control; nothing worse could hover near those blessed old
people upon their own hearth-stone. There every thing spoke of the old
time&mdash;the round table, covered with bird's-eye linen, homemade, glossy
as a snow crust, and as white. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span> same sprigged china and quaint
teaspoons. The silver teapot&mdash;old-fashioned even then&mdash;had been brought
out for the first time in years, and stood emitting dainty puffs of
steam between the andirons. The old lady looked at her son and at the
teapot with conscious smiles, which said plainly as smiles could speak,
"You see that I keep nothing back when my son comes home, not even
that!"</p>

<p>Thrasher smiled as he gathered in this picture. It was the smile of a
stern character, and changed his whole face. Rare must be the smile
which makes a human heart leap. You never heed perpetual sunshine, but
that which flashes through clouds makes itself felt and remembered.</p>

<p>"How much he looks like his father now," thought the mother, while the
old man held out his hand, and grasped that of his son with a hearty
"good-morning."</p>

<p>"Son," said the old lady, as she took up the teapot, with a little
flutter, like that of a bird pluming itself, "now that we are all
together&mdash;the whole family, you know&mdash;supposing we sit down at once.
Your father usually goes to prayers before breakfast, Nelson, but we'll
just put it off till afterward&mdash;don't you think so, husband?"</p>

<p>A strong sense of duty alone kept the old man from saying yes, at once;
but he wasn't to be led into temptation by the fond designs of that
precious little woman, not he; nor by the fear that his son would rather
not. Morning prayers didn't happen to be duties so lightly disposed of,
in his estimation. He motioned the old lady to leave the breakfast where
it was, on the hearth, and taking the great Bible from its stand, began
to read with solemn deliberation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Thrasher liked this; had his father varied in any thing from the steady
goodness of his character, it would have been a sad disappointment to
the son; for such persons are generally the most keen-sighted in
detecting the weakness of good men. Besides, there is something holy in
the religious associations of an early home, which no man or woman can
see disturbed without pain.</p>

<p>I am afraid that the old man, in compunction for a momentary impulse to
yield, made his prayer a little longer than usual, and dwelt elaborately
on that point which asked deliverance from temptation. Certain it is,
that according to the habit of the times, he spoke of himself as a
hardened sinner, and confessed to shortcomings and taints of original
depravity that must have made the recording angel&mdash;who had set down
nothing but good deeds to his account for many a long year&mdash;smile in
benign patience.</p>

<p>Once, as the good Christian gave signs of prolonging his devotions, the
old lady turned softly on her knees and pushed the dish, which contained
a choice delicacy for her son, close to the fire; but she blushed in the
act, and covering her face the instant it was accomplished, whispered
"amen" at the end of a sonorous sentence in which her husband
acknowledged the native depravity of every soul within the created
world.</p>

<p>Still Nelson Thrasher was not impatient. Every word of the old man's
voice thrilled him through and through. It would have taken something
more than that to upheave the stern selfishness of his character to any
purpose; but many a good feeling rose to the surface which, for the
time, made him a better man.</p>

<p>They sat down to breakfast at last, and a right hearty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span> New England
breakfast it was. The old man talked pleasantly on every subject that
came up. He possessed a clear, energetic mind, and had read a great deal
more than was common to his class. His intelligence was active to seize
on any food that presented itself, and his son's adventures by sea and
land, were as exciting as a romance; not that old Mr. Thrasher knew what
a romance was, or would have allowed one to enter his door if he had.
Indeed, the Pilgrim's Progress had disturbed his mind a good deal from
the fact that it was not an actual, instead of an ideal truth. As a
great many conscientious people condemn the theatre, but fill the boxes
of an opera, every night, this old-fashioned Christian listened to his
son's spoken romances with infinite zest. They appealed keenly to his
imagination, which found little aliment in any book he read, except when
it seized upon the grandest of all poetry&mdash;that of the Bible.</p>

<p>So the father asked questions, the son answered them pleasantly, and
that dear old lady sat smiling upon them both from behind her silver
teapot; convinced from the depths of her heart that she was the happiest
and most good-for-nothing old mother that ever drew the breath of life,
and ought to be ashamed of herself for not deserving all this joy more
thoroughly.</p>

<p>After breakfast, Thrasher took his hat, and prepared to go out. The old
gentleman, in the innocence of his heart, proposed to accompany him, but
Mrs. Thrasher began to nod and signalize him across the table, and he
sat down rather bewildered.</p>

<p>"Don't you see," said the old lady, with a sweet, knowing smile, "Nelson
is sure to find his way down to Mrs. Allen's&mdash;he must have loved us very
much to come by without stopping last night. I shouldn't wonder if that
girl kept him at home?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
"You don't say so!" exclaimed the father, in blank astonishment; "well,
I never thought of that."</p>

<p>"Why, don't you remember how often he used to go there the time he came
home before this, and how he went to York State to see her when she was
out there with her uncle that winter, going to school."</p>

<p>"Well, wife, I shouldn't wonder if there was something in it," said the
old man, going to the window and looking after his son.</p>

<p>The mother emitted a low, mellow laugh; she was rather proud of her
quicker penetration, and patronized the old gentleman accordingly.</p>

<p>"Why of course there's something in it," she said, nestling herself up
to his side, and putting a lock of gray hair back from his temples with
her finger. "He'll hang round her a little while&mdash;go down the hill two
or three times a day likely, while we don't seem to know any thing about
it&mdash;and then think he's surprising us, when he says that he's going to
marry Katharine Allen, if we've no objections. Of course we shan't have
any&mdash;for she's a nice girl and handsome as a picture. Then there'll be a
wedding down yonder. You'll buy the wine, and I'll find the cake. Mrs.
Allen has got lots of homespun, and Nelson won't want much for a setting
out, for this house isn't badly off for furniture, and I've been
thinking of a new cherry-tree chest of drawers some time."</p>

<p>The old man laughed pleasantly.</p>

<p>"My wife, you've got them married and to housekeeping before he's
crossed the top of the hill."</p>

<p>"But wouldn't it be nice? She's a smart girl, and might take a great
deal of care off me. As for Nelson, if he once took to farming what a
hand he would make at it!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
"And you believe all this?"</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I? there's nothing unnatural about it, nor wrong
either&mdash;besides I am sure Katharine likes him."</p>

<p>"Well, wife, any thing that keeps the boy at home will satisfy me.
Marriage is an institution of the Lord, and no good man should say a
word against it."</p>

<p>"Of course not, for that would be to slander our own youth. See, there
is Nelson now, looking down toward Mrs. Allen's house. That's him under
the but'nut tree. He's just stepped on the rock&mdash;you remember it. I
wonder what he's flirting out his silk handkerchief for?"</p>

<p>"It's to scare off the crows, I reckon," answered the father, watching
the movements of his son with some curiosity, "they're greater pests
than ever, this year."</p>

<p>"No," said the old lady, "it's more than that. See, something moves on
the other side of the stone wall. It's a woman&mdash;she's climbing over. Why
don't he help her, I wonder? Yes, just as I thought, it is Katharine
Allen. What do you say to that?"</p>

<p>"Well," answered the old man, flushing around the temples. "I say it
isn't likely the young folks think that we are spying after them. If
they want to have a talk by themselves, I'm sure we've no objections.
You and I have been but'nutting together in our lives, haven't we?"</p>

<p>I am not sure that the old man did not kiss the face that was lifted
smilingly to his. There was no one by, and he was so very happy all the
morning&mdash;who could wonder at it? The old lady, at any rate, made no ado
about the matter, but nestled a little closer to his side, and asked "if
he saw Nelson and Katharine yet?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
"They are sitting on the rock together, wife, talking, no doubt; but we
must not be watching them. Young folks don't like that, you know."</p>

<p>"Well, only just say that you think there's something in it, and I won't
turn my eyes that way again; though it's a trial for a mother not to
look on her son anywhere, after he has been away from home so long."</p>

<p>The father himself seemed to feel that it was a hardship, for, after
walking across the room once or twice, he came back to the window where
his wife still remained.</p>

<p>"See, husband, how Katharine jumps up and seems to be wringing her
hands. What can ail her?"</p>

<p>"Maybe Nelson is telling her about leaving her half-brother on the
wreck; that is enough to make the poor girl wring her hands&mdash;as for Mrs.
Allen, nothing but the grace of God can carry her through this trouble.
She hasn't seen her son for years, and was just expecting him home."</p>

<p>"Supposing I go right down and comfort her," whispered the good woman,
her heart full of tender pity. "Or would she rather be left alone, I
wonder?"</p>

<p>"Wait till the first grief goes off; after that, company may do her
good."</p>

<p>"Poor girl, how she takes on, while Nelson sits there as if nothing was
the matter. No, no, I am wrong; he's taken hold of her hands. He's
talking to her&mdash;how kind of him. See, Katharine is quieter already. She
sits down again; I know well enough, if any thing on earth could pacify
her, he could. The dear boy!"</p>

<a name="xvi" id="xvi"></a>CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">A PAINFUL INTERVIEW.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Truly</span>,
<a name="Katharine" id="Katharine"></a><ins title="Original has Catharine">Katharine</ins> Allen had sprung to her feet, and was
wringing her hands in wild, bitter grief, at the news of her
half-brother's death, for such she considered the account Thrasher gave
her. True, she had never seen Rice since she was a little girl, and he
was scarcely known in the neighborhood, as Mrs. Allen had moved to her
present home with her second husband, and her son had gone to sea long
before that. In her second widowhood, he had sometimes sent her money
and warm-hearted letters, written in a great, cramped hand, which no one
but a mother could have read. In her retired life, Mrs. Allen, who was a
middle-aged woman when Katharine was born, had looked forward to news
from her son as the great event of her life. With only her house, a few
acres of land, and her pretty daughter's labor to depend on for a
livelihood, the twenty and thirty dollars which came to her from this
son, at the end of each voyage, was a great help. Without it, the widow
and her beautiful daughter must have come to want, especially when
sickness was in the house.</p>

<p>Now he was dead&mdash;the brave, generous man, whom Katharine had been taught
to love like a father; and even while Thrasher told his own story, and
her loving heart was almost given up to fond credulity, she was not
quite satisfied that Rice might not have been saved. To leave him on the
wreck even at his own request, seemed to her a terrible cruelty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
"He was my brother," she said; "the only support we had. He was so
generous&mdash;so good to us both! Oh, Nelson, you should have saved him!"</p>

<p>"How did I know he was your brother, Katharine? He never told me a word
about it; and if I ever heard the name, it had escaped me."</p>

<p>"But he was a human being; a mother waited for him, somewhere. You
should have remembered that."</p>

<p>"It is useless talking in this way, Katharine," replied Thrasher,
striving to pacify her grief. "I could only have saved him by violence.
He would not come with us, but stuck to the wreck, under some wild idea
that she might yet be taken into port. I could have died with him, but
nothing beyond that was possible."</p>

<p>"Oh, my mother! my poor mother! must I tell her this?" moaned Katharine.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it would have pleased you better had I gone down with him?"</p>

<p>"You!&mdash;you! Oh, that would have completed our desolation! The news would
have killed me dead!"</p>

<p>"Then don't attempt to make me out a murderer."</p>

<p>"I haven't&mdash;I haven't!"</p>

<p>"Sit down,
<a name="Katharine2" id="Katharine2"></a><ins title="Original has Katherine">Katharine</ins>. These wild gestures will be seen from
the house, and the old people won't know what to make of it. Sit down
and compose yourself. This is not the only subject we have to talk
about."</p>

<p>"I know it&mdash;I know it; but the thought of carrying the grief to my
mother kills me."</p>

<p>"This is childish&mdash;I will submit to it no longer," cried Thrasher,
beginning to lose patience. "Sit down, I say, and control yourself!" He
took hold of her hands, grasping them till they burned with pain, and
drew her forcibly to the rock. She looked at him breathlessly; the
expression of his face frightened her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
"Now that you can be still," he said, sternly, "I have a great deal to
say about our conversation last night. Will you try and listen like a
rational creature?"</p>

<p>She was sobbing bitterly, and could only give an assent by a motion of
the head.</p>

<p>"Well, regarding the senseless event which you make so much of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Senseless, Nelson!" She looked up, as the words left her lips, and
gazed at him reproachfully through her tears.</p>

<p>"Yes, senseless! What else could an act like that be considered? I was a
man&mdash;and should have known better. What good has it done to be in such
desperate haste?"</p>

<p>"What good?&mdash;what good? Did we not love each other?"</p>

<p>Something like a sneer came to Thrasher's lip. He longed to tell her the
truth. It seemed the surest means of putting her out of the way.</p>

<p>"You don't speak, Nelson. You look strange when I say, 'Did we not love
each other?'"</p>

<p>"No wonder, Katharine&mdash;why should you ask the question? If to make a
fool of one's self is a proof of love, you have it!"</p>

<p>"To make a fool of one's self?" The poor girl turned white to the lips
as she repeated these insulting words. "What does this mean, Nelson?"</p>

<p>"It means that you and I went off, like a couple of dunces, and got
married!"</p>

<p>Katharine stopped crying. Surprise, for a moment, kept her mute; but
directly there came into her eyes a proud, almost fierce determination,
that Thrasher had never witnessed before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
"Do you mean this?" she said at last, in a low, clear voice, that made
him start.</p>

<p>"Mean what?"</p>

<p>"That you are sorry for having married me."</p>

<p>There was something in her face that startled him&mdash;that woman's
character had a depth and strength which he had not dreamed of until
then. It was not his habit to evade or equivocate much, but now he saw
the necessity.</p>

<p>"I haven't said that, and did not mean it, my sparrow-hawk. How could
I?"</p>

<p>"Then, what did you say?&mdash;what did you mean?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, except that it was a great folly&mdash;but a very pleasant
one&mdash;when we got married in that private way. It would have been better
to have waited."</p>

<p>"But it was you that urged me."</p>

<p>"To the marriage, but not the secrecy, that was your own doings
entirely, Kate. I wanted you to go at once and live with the old folks,
while I went this voyage, but you begged and pleaded to stay with your
mother, and what could I do but consent. Of course, as my wife, you must
have lived with my family, so you preferred secrecy and your mother. It
was a foolish arrangement altogether."</p>

<p>"My poor mother was so sad and lonely then, I could not bear to leave
her; besides, I did not dare tell her about it while she was in poor
health&mdash;she would have taken on dreadfully&mdash;for somehow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know she hated me."</p>

<p>"No, not that; but mother has strange prejudices."</p>

<p>"I should think she had. I have not forgotten her forbidding me the
house; but for that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What were you saying, Nelson? your voice is very husky."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
"I was saying that we should not have been led into the weakness of this
concealment if she had been more reasonable."</p>

<p>"Well, if it was a weakness or a sin I have suffered for it keenly
enough, Nelson. While my mother had those hard feelings I could not tell
her. Oh, Nelson, it seemed as if I should die when the time for your
return came and we heard nothing of the brig. If you had been lost, what
would have become of me? No one would have believed that I had ever been
married, no matter what I had said."</p>

<p>"But you had the certificate?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but the people here don't understand those things. They're used to
a publishment and all that. They never would see the difference between
Connecticut and York State. Then, if they had sent to my uncle he knew
nothing about it, you remember, and could not have helped me. Besides, I
didn't even know where to find the people that stood up with us."</p>

<p>"Why, child, all these fears are nonsense. The certificate is enough."</p>

<p>"But it's all of no consequence now. You are here and we can speak out.
It isn't like a poor girl being all alone without knowing any thing of
the law."</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="xvii" id="xvii"></a>CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">JEALOUS PANGS REGARDING MRS. MASON.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Thrasher</span> sat with his hands clasped over one knee, looking thoughtfully
on the ground as she spoke. Katharine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span> had nestled close to his side,
and was looking wistfully into his face.</p>

<p>"There isn't any trouble now, Nelson. Mother may be angry for awhile,
but it won't be forever."</p>

<p>"I was thinking," said Thrasher, with his eyes resolutely fixed on the
ground, "I was thinking that, as it had gone so far, we had better put
off telling about it till after my next trip."</p>

<p>Katharine turned white, and suddenly shrank away from him. He did not
seem to notice it, but went on in the same even voice.</p>

<p>"It will not be long&mdash;not more than two or three months at the most."</p>

<p>Katharine held her breath and listened, but sobs were gathering thick
and heavy in her bosom.</p>

<p>"Three months!&mdash;three months! Oh, Nelson!" and now the sobs broke forth
with painful violence.</p>

<p>"It may be less than that&mdash;I will get the shortest voyage that can be
found. But for the shipwreck this might not have been so necessary; as
it is, one must have a little money to go to housekeeping with. You
wouldn't have me ask my father for that?"</p>

<p>"No, no. Besides, what would mother do without me just now&mdash;with this
dreadful news to bear up against?" cried Katharine, hushing her sobs.</p>

<p>"I was sure you would see the whole thing in this sensible way, dear."</p>

<p>Katharine wiped her eyes and made a miserable effort to smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose it is best. But what if something happens to keep you
away longer?&mdash;I should die! I should die!"</p>

<p>"But nothing can happen. If it should&mdash;that is, if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span> do not come back
in three months at the furthest&mdash;take your certificate, go up to my
mother, show it to her, and tell the old folks to take care of you for
my sake; for after that, you may consider yourself a widow!"</p>

<p>"A widow?"</p>

<p>"Yes, beyond a doubt; for if I do not come back in three months, be sure
that nothing but death keeps me!"</p>

<p>"Don't! don't!" cried the poor wife, lifting her hands as if to ward off
a blow.</p>

<p>"Well, well; there's nothing so dreadful about all this. One would
think, by that face, you saw me in the water now, with a stone at my
feet."</p>

<p>Again Katharine held up her hands and shut her eyes. The picture was too
dreadful.</p>

<p>Spite of himself, Thrasher was touched by this evidence of affection; he
changed his position, and stole his arm around her waist.</p>

<p>"There, now, we have settled all this terrible business, and can talk of
brighter things," he said, caressingly. "Have you seen much of the old
people since I went away?"</p>

<p>"I had no heart to go there often; but sometimes I saw your father at
the gate. He always stopped if I was there when he rode by; and when
mother was sick, Mrs. Thrasher always came."</p>

<p>"Dear old lady!" said Thrasher, with emotion. "When was she ever away
when help could be given? Under all circumstances she will be good to
you, wife or widow."</p>

<p>"Don't use that word widow; it makes me cold."</p>

<p>"Yet it is sometimes a pleasant word," said Thrasher, forgetting her
presence in thoughts of another.</p>

<p>"A pleasant word, Nelson?"</p>

<p>"Pleasant!-did I say so? How strange that one's tongue will make such
blunders."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Katharine was thoughtful for a moment. Something in her husband's manner
brought back the feelings she had experienced at Mrs. Mason's house the
night before. Vague spasms of jealousy, that culminated in a sharp pang
when she remembered that the beautiful woman who had almost taunted her,
was a widow now.</p>

<p>"Nelson," she said, awaking from her grief, for there was something of
indignation mingled with it now, "last night I was at Mrs. Mason's."</p>

<p>"Indeed? Have you visited her often?"</p>

<p>"Only when I went to get news of the ship; for I don't much like her."</p>

<p>"Indeed?"</p>

<p>"No; she hurts one's feelings without meaning it, I dare say. Her
haughtiness keeps every one at a distance."</p>

<p>Thrasher turned his face away, to conceal the proud smile that broke
over it. He longed to defend the haughtiness of which Katharine
complained&mdash;to say that it was the birthright of Ellen's great
superiority over all other women. But he checked the impulse and only
answered:</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is so. I have seen very little of her since she married
that&mdash;that&mdash;I mean since she married Captain Mason."</p>

<p>"She told me something last night that surprised me."</p>

<p>"What was it?"</p>

<p>"She said that you had loved her before she accepted Captain Mason, and
that she refused you."</p>

<p>"Ah, she told you that; and did her ladyship tell you why she took Mason
instead of me?"</p>

<p>"Because you was a third or second mate, I forget which, and he was a
captain; that was the reason she gave&mdash;but you speak as if it were
true."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
"Well, when I say that I had never been to sea in my life when John
Mason married Ellen Palmer, you'll probably believe this nonsense."</p>

<p>"Then it was not true!" cried Katharine, smiling happily the first time
that day.</p>

<p>"When women boast of their conquests, they seldom are true, Kate."</p>

<p>"But how unfeeling to say all this to me, your wife!"</p>

<p>"She didn't know that; with a secret like ours, one is always getting
into trouble, Kate; as for this haughty woman, I would not go near her
again&mdash;she'll find you out in no time."</p>

<p>Katharine smiled with a little bitterness.</p>

<p>"I suppose she would, for when the heart is full, it is hard to look
calm. Last night I longed to tell the woman to her face, that I had a
right to inquire after you&mdash;just as good a right as she had to be taking
on about her husband."</p>

<p>"But you did not?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. I only sat and cried. The little girl seemed to grudge
me that comfort, for she said I had no husband nor father off to sea,
and she couldn't tell what I wanted to cry for like her own mother."</p>

<p>"The little fool!" sneered Thrasher. "So they were having a general
season of mourning, because Mason did not present himself?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly that," said Katharine; "still, I was sorry for Mrs. Mason
and the little girl, for they felt bad enough; and now, when you are
safe&mdash;when I ought to be so happy&mdash;it is a shame to talk over their
faults. I dare say she didn't mean any thing. Such women sometimes fancy
that men want to offer themselves who never had the idea. Besides, I
told Mrs. Mason to her face that I didn't believe a word of it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Thrasher laughed.</p>

<p>"And so you managed to get up a little sparring-match between you, and
all upon my account?"</p>

<p>"Not quite that," answered Katharine, laughing also. "But I was so
disappointed that every thing went wrong. Besides, it's no use denying
it, Mrs. Mason made me angry. The idea of a married woman speaking of
her offers! But then, you never did make her an offer&mdash;and I knew it."</p>

<p>"Well, any way, you have a pretty sure safeguard that I never shall make
her one."</p>

<p>Katharine's face brightened beautifully. She looked toward him with a
long, steady glance of affection. Tears trembled on her long lashes, and
shone like dew where they had fallen on the damask of her cheek. But the
smile upon her mouth, and the tenderness in her eyes, were enough to
excuse any man for remembering, just then, that she was his own wife.</p>

<p>Thrasher drew her toward him, and kissed her with hearty warmth for the
first time since his return home.</p>

<p>I am afraid the dear old people standing by the window saw it, for they
looked at each other slyly and turned away.</p>

<br />
<span class="sub">MRS. MASON'S RICH UNCLE IN THE SOUTH.</span></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Mother</span>!"</p>

<p>"Well, Katharine?"</p>

<p>"Nelson Thrasher came home last night."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
"Better have stayed away!" answered the stern old lady, thrusting her
knitting-needle into the goose-quill tube of her sheath, which was
fastened, like the leaf of some great, red flower, on the right side of
her waist. "No good ever followed his coming, that I ever heard of."</p>

<p>The color came into Katharine's face at this, for no woman likes to hear
the man she loves spoken lightly of. Still she was striving to lead her
mother's mind quietly to the bad news which lay heavy at her own heart,
and did not feel the scornful tones in which the words were spoken, as
she would have done.</p>

<p>For a little time there was no sound save the rattle of Mrs. Allen's
needle in its sheath, which grew quicker and sharper each moment&mdash;a sure
sign that the old lady was disturbed in her mind. After knitting twice
round the top of a mixed stocking with unceasing vigor, amid a great
click and rattle of the needles, she drew a length of yarn from the ball
in her lap, with a jerk, and commenced again more deliberately.
Katharine sat still, for she knew that this was preliminary to a renewal
of the conversation. The first words, however, came out with a
suddenness that made her start.</p>

<p>"Have you seen that fellow?"</p>

<p>Katharine could keep a secret, to her sorrow, poor thing; but she was
incapable of a direct falsehood, so she answered truly, but with a
quiver of fear in her voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, he overtook me on my way home from Mrs. Mason's, last
night."</p>

<p>"You saw him last night, last night, and got no word of my son. Where is
he&mdash;when will he come, Katharine Allen? You could not have forgotten to
ask."</p>

<p>"No, mother; but I&mdash;I was afraid to say any thing&mdash;indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span> I did not
know until this morning, for I saw him under the great butternut tree by
the road, and went out&mdash;I did not know what sad news he brought."</p>

<p>"Sad news of my son!" cried the woman, drawing herself up as if to ward
off a blow; "did you say sad news, Katharine?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother," answered the beautiful girl, stealing close to the
high-backed chair that her own face might be concealed, but her voice
and limbs shook with the emotion she strove to suppress, and this the
old woman felt to the core of her heart.</p>

<p>"Is my son dead?" she inquired, in a deep, hoarse voice.</p>

<p>"I fear so, mother."</p>

<p>"Fear! if you are not sure, speak out. Can't you see that I must know,
or&mdash;or drop dead in my chair!"</p>

<p>"They were wrecked. My brother, my poor, poor brother would not abandon
the vessel. They were compelled to leave him."</p>

<p>"They&mdash;who?"</p>

<p>"Every soul on board&mdash;no, I remember a negro and a little boy stayed
with him."</p>

<p>"And the man Nelson Thrasher left my son on the stormy seas to die?"</p>

<p>"No, no, he only went with the rest; besides, he did not know, 'till I
told him, that David was my brother, or your son."</p>

<p>"And they left him alone on the high seas to starve or drown," said the
old woman, hoarsely. "Katharine Allen, never mention that man's name to
me while you live. If you see him passing my house, give warning, that I
may turn away and not curse him."</p>

<p>"Oh! mother, mother!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
"Be still, girl!"</p>

<p>The old woman's face was bloodless as parchment. She tried to go on with
her work, but it fell from her hands, while she, unconscious of the
loss, kept on with the motion of knitting, and looked down with her
heavy black eyes as if she were counting the stitches that were only
made in air.</p>

<p>"Mother, dear mother!"</p>

<p>The old lady did not speak, but the two hands dropped heavily in her
lap, and her face fell down upon her bosom. The stillness of her grief
was appalling. Katharine knelt before her, pale as death.</p>

<p>"Ob, mother, speak to me!"</p>

<p>All at once the old woman sat upright.</p>

<p>"Katharine Allen, tell me word for word what that man said to you of my
son David."</p>

<p>"Be composed, don't look so hard, and I will&mdash;you shake so, mother."</p>

<p>"No, I do not shake. Pick up that knitting needle. There, do I knit
evenly?" She placed the needle in its sheath, and began taking her
stitches with slow precision.</p>

<p>True enough, her nerves were braced like steel, and like steel were her
features locked. Katharine, poor soul, repeated what Thrasher had told
her of the shipwreck, faithfully; softening it with the sweet tenderness
of her voice, and putting in a word of excuse here and there. Then she
came to the end, and told how that little boy and his noble slave
insisted upon staying with Rice, after they had been saved from the very
jaws of death&mdash;a terrible death&mdash;like that which threatened him.</p>

<p>Now the old woman's heart began to heave, and her great, heavy eyes
kindled with living fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
"Katharine," she said, "were these three martyrs alive when the cowards
left them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother."</p>

<p>"Brave spirits," cried the old lady, rising suddenly. "They were in the
hands of a merciful God, and he will save them! We will not mourn David
as lost till that wreck is heard from. He is wise, and had courage. Had
there been no hope he would have left with the rest."</p>

<p>Katharine's face brightened.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, if it should prove so!"</p>

<p>"God did not inspire that brave child and the negro to stand by him for
nothing. I <i>feel</i> that he is alive in the return of my own strength.
When a strong man dies, his mother should feel weak, though he were a
thousand miles off. But I, look, am I feeble and drooping, as if the
staff of my age were torn from under me. If I stand upright, it is
because he was, he is a good man. If I feel a power of vitality here, it
is a proof that kindred life beats somewhere in response to it."</p>

<p>Katharine gazed at her mother in astonishment. There was something
sublime in her great faith, a grandeur in her attitude like that which
we give to a prophetess of the Bible. In her language and voice she
seemed lifted out of herself.</p>

<p>Katharine always held her mother in profound reverence, in which love
and fear were so equally blended, that she was seldom quite at rest in
her presence. Now these feelings arose almost to religious exaltation.
With all the softening influence of love and youth about her, she
possessed many of the vigorous and noble traits which gave the old woman
an acknowledged superiority in the neighborhood. With her mother's
faith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span> her hopes arose, and coming out of their deep grief the two sat
down together, and strove to wrest some assurance of the son and
brother's safety from the news that had reached them.</p>

<p>"He is alive&mdash;I feel that he is alive&mdash;my noble, strong boy!" said the
old woman, as she laid her head on the pillow, but a heavy fear lay at
her heart all the time.</p>

<p>"He was alive, and while there is life we may hope," whispered
Katharine, sadly, as she sank to an unquiet sleep. A heavier sorrow,
alas, lay upon her; the sorrow of a corroding secret which the last few
hours had rendered almost a guilty burden from the new causes of
detestation that had sprung up between her mother and the man she had so
rashly married.</p>

<p>Thus every thing conspired to keep that young creature
silent&mdash;Thrasher's request and the mother's prejudices, made more bitter
by that man's desertion of her son in his hour of need, kept the secret
weighed down in her bosom. True, this prejudice seemed very
unreasonable; no one had compelled Rice to remain on the wreck. The same
means of escape which brought the others home in safety was free to him;
but a feeling stronger than facts possessed the old lady. Dead or alive,
she believed that some treachery had been practiced on her son, and that
the traitor was Nelson Thrasher.</p>

<p>Katharine remembered that the man was her husband&mdash;that in a few months
she might be called upon to choose between the mother whom she regarded
with loving reverence and the husband whom she almost adored. No wonder
the poor girl shrunk from the moment which was to force the
heart-rending decision upon her. It was a terrible position for one so
young and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span> helpless. Between these two strong, positive characters,
there was little hope of tranquillity for her, even though a partial
reconciliation should take place.</p>

<p>One gleam of consolation did break upon her that night, when she
remembered her mother's faith. David Rice was as good, as noble-hearted
a man as ever drew breath. It was the forlorn hope that he yet lived,
and would mediate for her and her husband with the stern mother.</p>

<p>It was impossible for Thrasher to visit Mrs. Allen's house; Katharine
told him so on their next interview. Thus the young wife had no cause to
complain that he spent but little time with her, and seemed both
occupied and anxious when they did meet.</p>

<p>After the news which had disturbed her so, the old lady kept her room,
and all the duties of the house fell upon Katharine, so that she had
little opportunity to go any distance from home, and the gossip of the
neighborhood seldom reached her.</p>

<p>Indeed, there was almost nothing for her to hear. Thrasher held very
slight intercourse with the neighbors; and as his father's farm was,
like Mrs. Allen's house, isolated among the hills, they knew little of
his movements. That he occasionally was seen going down the footpath
that led to Mrs. Mason's cottage in the pine woods, counted for nothing.
Mason had been his captain, and it was but kind and right that he should
offer sympathy to the widow. All the neighborhood was excited to pity in
her behalf. What could she do, so proud and helpless, with that pretty
child to support?</p>

<p>The widow was very desponding at first, and went about the house
mournfully, her beautiful eyes heavy with tears, and her red lips ready
to tremble if any one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span> spoke to her. Compassion for her became general.
The kind farmers stopped on their way from mill, and insisted on leaving
a baking of flour at the gate. Pretty girls came with their aprons full
of newly-laid eggs; and a little fellow, diverging every morning from
his way to school, set a small tin pail, bright as silver, through the
fence, and ran away as if he had been stealing. The pail always
contained milk, with more cream in it than ever came there naturally,
and sometimes, on the grass close by it, Mrs. Mason found a roll of
golden butter folded up in a cool cabbage leaf.</p>

<p>Was it these kindnesses that softened the widow's grief, and brought the
rich bloom back to her cheek so early after her loss? or had she some
hidden source of consolation which kindled her face into more superb
beauty, as the earth looks fresher and more heavenly after a tempest?
Certain it was, her step soon regained its firmness, and her person its
haughty poise. She spoke of Captain Mason less frequently, and there was
in her manner something that surprised the good neighbors and repelled
their sympathies. She seemed ashamed of the meagre attempts at mourning
that she had been enabled to make; and exhausted quantities of vinegar
and cold tea in refreshing bits of French crape and breadths of
bombazine, which would look worn and rusty spite of all she could do,
and this brought tears into her eyes when they had ceased to weep for
deeper cares.</p>

<p>But, as I have said, after awhile all her beauty and animation came
back. She began to talk hopefully of an uncle, who lived away off in the
South, who would, perhaps, send for her and little Rose, when he
received her letter, informing him of the helpless state in which they
had been left. No one of the neighbors had ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span> heard of this uncle
before, and her constant boasting about his wealth and the style in
which he lived, rather set them aback. It cast their own little kindness
quite into the shade. How could they offer fresh eggs and rolls of
butter to a woman who wore her cheap black dress like a queen, and
talked of pearls and diamonds all the day long, as if she had discovered
a mine, and wanted to find out its exact value.</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="xix" id="xix"></a>CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">MRS. MASON LEAVES THE PINE WOODS.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> last, Mrs. Mason announced that the expected letter had arrived, with
money for her expenses to the South&mdash;she never told the exact
locality&mdash;and that she and little Rose would set forth at once, taking
the steamboat from New Haven to New York, where her passage southward
was already engaged.</p>

<p>All this was very magnificent and almost startling, but corroborated by
a supply of money which the widow evidently possessed, and by the
disposition of her little household furniture, which she distributed
among her friends with the careless prodigality of a princess.</p>

<p>The preparations for her departure went on spiritedly. With nothing to
prepare; for all her new mourning dresses, she announced, were to be
made in New York; it was only packing a small trunk, and taking leave of
the old neighbors, and she was ready with little Rose to go forth into
her new life. A neighbor had been engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span> to take her to town in a
dashing, one horse wagon, which he had just bought, and in this way the
whole arrangement promised to go off with the eclat which the widow
Mason always affected.</p>

<p>Thus time passed until the night before her journey. The furniture had
not yet been removed, and every thing retained the old homelike aspect;
from any appearance of confusion that existed, you would have fancied
that the mistress of the house was only going out for a morning drive.
She seemed rather elated than otherwise, and received her friends with
half royal condescension, not absolutely offensive, but calculated to
check the honest grief with which old neighbors parted on those days
when a household was breaking up. Many kind wishes were, however,
exchanged, little presents were brought in, such as patchwork holders,
work bags, and pincushions, besides a pair of fine, lambs' wool mittens,
knitted by the oldest woman in the town, was presented to her with a
gentle message of farewell, followed by various other trifles,
calculated to appeal eloquently to a kind heart. All these, the widow
received with concealed and smiling indifference, thinking in her soul
how paltry such things were to a person of her expectations.</p>

<p>But little Rose made up for all her mother's lack of feeling. She was
broken-hearted at the thought of leaving her playmates, burst into tears
when the old people patted her on the head, and refused to be comforted
by all the promises of grandeur which were whispered in her ear, either
by her mother or her friends.</p>

<p>That night&mdash;after the neighbors had gone away, and Rose was in bed
hugging a home-made doll which one of the little girls had brought
her&mdash;a boy who had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span> kept late with his lessons, climbed softly over
the door yard fence. He was afraid that the gate would creak, and
disturb the family if Rose should be in bed; so with a long string of
robins' eggs held in one hand, he leaped into the grass and stole softly
up to one of the front windows. A corner of the paper blind was turned
up by the back of a chair which it had fallen against, and through this
opening, our little adventurer saw clearly into the room. First, he
looked for Rose, the object of his juvenile idolatry; but her little
chair was empty, and her tiny morocco shoes and red worsted stockings
lay in a heap on the seat, sure proofs that she had gone to bed.</p>

<p>This was a sad disappointment to the lad, but he soon forgot it in the
surprise which followed. Mrs. Mason and some strange man were sitting by
a work table, which stood near the window. A tallow candle shed its
light on the widow's face, but the man sat with his back to the window,
his features all in deep shadow. His hand was extended half over the
table, clutching a quantity of gold or silver coins, the boy could not
tell which, for gold money he had never seen, and the pieces that
escaped between the man's fingers, and fell ringing on the table, might
have been Spanish quarters, or guineas, for aught he knew. At any rate,
that great handful of money seemed a marvellous sum to him, and when
Mrs. Mason received it in her two hands, he wondered that she did not
jump for joy. But instead of this, she took a variegated work bag from
the table drawer, poured the money into it with some smiling remark, and
crossing the room, unlocked her trunk and placed the bag in one corner.</p>

<p>While she was thus occupied, the lad observed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span> strange looking box
upon the table, which the person still sitting there had opened. A
bright flash came out of the box, as if something had struck fire
within. Mrs. Mason came back to the table. She had taken off her
mourning dress, replacing it with a black silk skirt and dimity short
gown, with loose, open sleeves that left her fine arms partially
exposed, every time she lifted them. She came up to the table and seemed
struck with wonder, for lifting up both arms, she uttered an exclamation
of delight which the boy heard clearly.</p>

<p>The man snatched something from the box, arose, and seized her arm. A
little struggle followed, quick, impassioned words, which the listener
did not understand, but he saw that the man was pleading for something
which she smilingly refused. That boy knew at last what it meant; he had
begged and coaxed exactly in the same way for a good-by kiss, which
little Rose resisted, almost as her mother was doing now. He had
promised the very string of robins' eggs in his hand, as a temptation,
and all to no effect. He remembered his own disappointment, and rather
pitied the poor man, who, baffled and mortified, bent down and kissed
Mrs. Mason's arm, just above a glittering band which circled the wrist,
flashing there like a ribbon of fire.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mason was evidently angry and resentful, even of this liberty. She
tore the bracelet from her arm, and tossed it haughtily into the box.
Still the man's back was toward the window, so it was impossible to mark
the effect this had on him, save by the droop of his shoulders, and a
deprecating action of the hands. But the widow motioned him away,
frowning heavily. The man sat down, closed the box, and bent his
forehead upon it. She leaned over the table and spoke to him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span> He
started up with a suddenness that frightened the lad, who leaped the
fence like a deer, and fled up the road.</p>

<p>It was a long time before the boy ever mentioned what he had witnessed
that night. The remembrance of his own shy feelings about little Rose
kept him silent. Besides this, he had a consciousness that there was
something to be ashamed of in peeping through the windows of a
neighbor's house, and so wisely kept his peace about what he had
discovered in this
<a name="surreptitious" id="surreptitious"></a><ins title="Original has surreptitous">surreptitious</ins> manner.</p>

<p>The next morning, a little group of neighbors gathered to see Mrs. Mason
off. A light, yellow wagon, stood before the gate, a restive, gray
horse, stamped and chafed beneath his harness till it rattled again. The
widow was shaking hands in the entry, while the proud owner of that
equipage carried out her little hair trunk, and put it behind the seat.
Rose was crying bitterly over a gray kitten that came and rubbed itself
against her ankles, and purred as if it rather enjoyed the unusual
commotion. This pretty child really seemed to feel the parting from her
home much more keenly than her mother.</p>

<p>It was the father of the bright boy that had so naughtily looked into
the window&mdash;who owned the wagon. With his heart full of grief, the poor
fellow had begged a ride, and stood dolefully by the gate, peeping at
little Rose through an opening of the boards.</p>

<p>At last Mrs. Mason came forth into the morning sunshine, prepared for
her journey. The earth was wet, and she gathered up the skirt of her
dark dress, as a queen manages her train, revealing a finely shaped
foot, with which she trod daintily through the grass. Really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span> it was
difficult to say which struck the beholder most forcibly in that woman;
the regal style with which she carried herself, or the marvellous
physical beauty which gave grace to her very haughtiness. No one could
deny that she was a superb creature, even in that cheap bombazine dress
and gloomy black bonnet.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mason took her seat in the wagon. The owner placed himself by her
side, and began to unwind the long lash from his whip handle, with the
air of a man who meant to do the thing up handsomely. Little Rose had
been lifted over the wheel, and placed into the centre of the seat, like
an exclamation point in the middle of a short sentence. Thus they were
all crowded together a little uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"Wait, wait," cried the lad, dashing into the house, and bringing forth
Rose's tiny arm-chair with its pretty crimson cushion. "There," he said,
choking back a great sob, "if pa brings it back in the wagon, maybe
you'll let me keep it; nobody shall ever sit in it, Rose, 'till you come
home again."</p>

<p>Then Rose covered her face with two dimpled little hands that were wet
all over in a moment. "Oh, don't&mdash;la, don't!"</p>

<p>The lad sprang up on the hub of the front wheel, and laid the string of
robins' eggs into her lap, his face all in a blaze, and his eyes full of
tears.</p>

<p>"Don't forget me, Rose, don't&mdash;no boy will ever love you half so much as
I do."</p>

<p>Rose dropped her hands, looked down at the blue eggs in her lap, and
throwing her arms around his neck, kissed him three or four times.</p>

<p>The farmer and Mrs. Mason looked at each other, and laughed softly. The
boy heard them, sprang down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span> from the wheel, and dashed into the house,
where no one could see what a great baby he was ready to make of
himself. Then he watched the wagon drive off through a flood of blinding
tears, while little Rose flung kisses back at random, sobbing as if her
heart would break, and wondering if any of them would reach him.</p>

<p>When the farmer returned from his ten miles' drive into New Haven, he
brought news that a steamboat lay at the foot of "Long Wharf," ready to
sail in half an hour after Mrs. Mason reached it, and that he saw her go
on board in great spirits, with Rose, who had cried all the way, but
seemed a little pacified by the sight of the broad waters, and the great
puffing boat in which she was about to cross them.</p>

<p>Nelson Thrasher happened to be standing near when the farmer said this,
and one of the rare smiles I have spoken of crossed his face, but he
made no observations, and soon took a cross-cut through the fields which
led him by Mrs. Allen's, on his way home. Katharine was watching for him
at the back window. She had heard of Mrs. Mason's journey, and exulted a
little when Nelson passed the house on his way to Falls Hill, an hour
after she had started. All that night she had been troubled lest he
should wish to bid the widow farewell; for, spite of herself, a
lingering distrust still kept its hold on her heart, when she remembered
the conversation of that evening.</p>

<p>Thrasher saw her at the window, and made a signal, which soon brought
her outside of the stone wall, and under a huge apple tree, which flung
its branches across it and into the garden.</p>

<p>Never since his return had Thrasher seemed so cheerful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span> He even
inquired after the old lady with something of interest, and spoke of the
time when she would regard him with less prejudice. All this gave
Katharine a lighter heart; her beauty, which had been dimmed by
adversity of late, bloomed out again. If not so stately as Mrs. Mason,
she was far more lovely, and her fair, sweet face was mobile with
sentiments which the widow could not have understood. Compared to that
woman, she was like the apple blossoms of May contrasted with autumn
fruit&mdash;one a child of the pure, bright spring, appealing to the
imagination; the other a growth of storm, sunshine, and dew, mellowing
down from its first delicate beauty to a perfection of ripeness which
sense alone can appreciate. There existed elements in that young
creature's character from which the best poetry of life is wrought.
Heroism, self-abnegation, endurance, and truthfulness&mdash;all these
rendered her moral character beautiful as her person.</p>

<p>But, alas! our future pages will prove all this. Why should we attempt
to foreshadow in words a destiny and a nature like hers? It is enough
that she looked lovely as an April morning that bright day, as she stood
under the apple tree, leaning against the mossy old wall, talking to her
husband, sometimes with her lips, sometimes with her wonderful eyes,
which said a thousand loving things that her voice refused to utter. He
fell into the current of her cheerfulness, and chatted pleasantly, till
the slanting shadows warned her that the tea hour had arrived, and that
her mother would be impatient. With his kisses warm upon her mouth, she
went singing into the house, happy and rich in sudden joyousness.</p>

<a name="xx" id="xx"></a>CHAPTER XX.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">ANOTHER SEPARATION.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was about two weeks after Mrs. Mason's departure, when Thrasher began
to talk of going to sea again. This depressed his parents greatly. They
had hoped that his attachment to Katharine Allen would have kept him at
the homestead. Thus they had carefully avoided any allusion to the
subject of his departure, satisfied that every thing was progressing to
forward their wishes. When he spoke of going away in the course of
another week, it was a terrible shock to them, and seemed a painful
subject to himself.</p>

<p>Katharine had, from the first, expected his departure&mdash;its necessity had
been urged upon her on their first meeting under the butternut tree. She
acquiesced in his decision then, and never thought of disputing it
afterward. But, as the time drew near, she became very sad&mdash;vague doubts
beset her night and day&mdash;formless, reasonless, as she strove to convince
herself; but the struggle was always going on&mdash;the feelings reasoned out
of her mind overnight, were certain to return in the morning.</p>

<p>It was a sorrowful position for a young creature like her, inexperienced
every way, needing counsel as no human being ever required it before,
yet afraid to breathe a word of the trouble that oppressed her, lest it
should alienate her entirely from her suffering mother, whom, next to
Thrasher, she loved with the tenderest devotion.</p>

<p>It was an honor to this young creature that she bore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span> all this load of
anxiety without a single word of complaint. She felt that all the
concealment that followed her marriage had sprung from her own desire.
But the dread of giving pain to her mother had exerted an overpowering
influence over her. Thrasher had not seemed to care about the matter.
Whether his marriage was proclaimed at once or not, had been a subject
of indifference. If secrecy had become more important now, she did not
realize it; but imagined that he was still indulging her fears rather
than guiding them. The sad news that he had brought, the sickness it had
inflicted upon her mother, were stern reasons why she should not speak
then.</p>

<p>All this Thrasher knew, and was content to leave things to their natural
course. So, instead of offering hindrance to his departure, Katharine
was almost anxious for him to go, that his return within the promised
time might be more certain.</p>

<p>Still the young man lingered at the homestead, though letters reached
him from New York twice in one week, from ship owners, he said, urging
him to be on hand for a fresh voyage, where, he could not exactly tell.
The vessel belonged to no established line, but traded with the West
Indies, generally.</p>

<p>The old people were inconsolable. It seemed, they both said plaintively,
as if they were parting with their son forever. Why must he leave them
again? The homestead and all they possessed in the world should be his
if he would but marry and settle down. They only wanted a comfortable
room in some corner of the old house, where, with a knowledge of his
presence and happiness, their content would be perfect.</p>

<p>He could not answer these tender entreaties, but sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span> moodily, striving
not to listen. His mind was made up&mdash;his career marked out. The great
loves of his life were antagonistic; one must be surrendered&mdash;the holy
or the unholy. He turned from the wholesome fruit, and took that which
was ashen at the core.</p>

<p>Thrasher might have avoided the last farewell; but painful as it was, he
could not force himself to leave the old people unawares. The last
evening must come, the last good-night must be said. He would listen to
the old man's voice on his knees once more, and let his mother kiss him,
as of old, before he went to sleep in that house for the last time. It
was all very painful&mdash;worse than leaving his young wife; worse than
death, he said to himself, a hundred times; all his innocent memories,
all his household affections, to be torn up at the roots by his own
hands. For what, and for whom?</p>

<p>Would other love come into his life and compensate for this which he
threw away? His teeth were clenched, and great drops stood on his
forehead, as he asked these questions. But his resolve was made; nothing
could change that&mdash;not even the gentle old woman, with sweet motherly
love in her eyes, who came and sat by him so meekly, and talked of the
next thanksgiving, when he would be at home again, and they would have
such a dinner. She had set aside the plumpest young turkey on the farm,
and it should not be killed till he came back&mdash;thanksgiving or no
thanksgiving.</p>

<p>God help the man! He stood out against all this; every affectionate
string in his heart trembled in the struggle, but his bad, strong will,
carried him through.</p>

<p>That night he met Katharine by the old stone wall, when they bade each
other farewell. He was gentle to her then, and his voice was so full of
anguish, that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span> gathered up her strength to comfort him. The poor
girl spoke hopefully of the little time they would be apart, and how
constantly she would think of him&mdash;pray for him. She dwelt, too, on
other things&mdash;on the great happiness that would come in the future. Her
voice grew soft with tenderness, and her sweet face looked heavenly in
the starlight, as she made this womanly effort to console him; but his
eyes were cast down, and a heavy, leaden feeling, weighed upon his
shoulders. Dumb and granite-hearted, he listened, striving not to hear.</p>

<p>Katharine's time was up; in a few minutes her old mother would be
calling for her. She already saw her tall person casting its shadow
across the window, as she walked to and fro, impatient of her
loneliness.</p>

<p>"Nelson, I must go!"</p>

<p>The anguish that broke forth in these words smote through his heart,
making it leap and tremble, but leaving only a gleam of tenderness
behind. The rock of his stern will was unbroken even by that cry, from a
heart as true and loving as ever beat in a woman's bosom.</p>

<p>He trembled from head to foot, within the clasp of her arms; cold,
spasmodic kisses were pressed on her face. The hands which grasped hers
at last, were cold as ice.</p>

<p>They parted thus. He turned and walked heavily away, while Katharine
went back to her mother, entreating God to help her bear this
separation. It was only for a little time, she murmured over and over
again; but even then, she had need of strength from heaven.</p>

<p>Few words were uttered in the Thrasher homestead that night. The old man
sat upon the hearth, grave and heavy hearted, smoking at intervals, but
quite unconscious when the pipe went out between his lips.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span> The mother
held her knitting work&mdash;she would not have been herself without it&mdash;but
her fingers rested motionless on the needles half the time, and she sat
gazing wistfully upon the floor till the tears blinded her. Then she
would start, look meekly around, to be sure that she was not observed,
and wipe her eyes with the cotton handkerchief which she softly drew
from her pocket.</p>

<p>Thrasher saw all this, and the iron heart almost melted within him. If
the dear old people suffered thus at a temporary parting, what would the
future bring them? Again the struggle commenced, battled, strove,
tortured him, but ended as before.</p>

<p>In the morning, long before daylight, he arose, and with a valise in his
hand, went away, leaving every thing behind him in darkness. When the
old people missed him, they said very gently to one another, "He could
not bear to say good-by. It was his kind heart. Our Nelson always was
kind-hearted."</p>

<p>Katharine, who had watched at her window from dawn until the sun was
high, growing pale and sad every moment, heard that he was gone, and
whispered, amid her tears, "His heart failed him; he shrunk from seeing
my poor face again&mdash;my own dear husband; how kind-hearted he is!"</p>

<h2><a name="xxi" id="xxi"></a>CHAPTER XXI.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">THE MINISTER AT BAYS HOLLOW GETS A WIFE.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I dare</span> say that the village to which I take my reader is a town of some
importance now; but years ago, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span> was nothing but a cluster of houses
snugly nested in a valley, through which a small stream wound itself,
sinuously creeping through the meadows and along the base of the hills,
in so many picturesque windings, that you really could not tell in what
direction it was destined to run at last, north or south.</p>

<p>The village stood at two crossroads, which the river intersected three
or four times; besides, a brook from the hills met it just below the
corners, demanding a little plank bridge for itself, over which a clump
of golden willows bent and sighed pleasantly all the day long. A great,
square, barnlike meeting-house, with pews laid out like town lots, and
aisles broader than any street in Constantinople, occupied the centre of
the village. A range of wagon sheds stood behind it, and a small prairie
of greensward lay all around it. There had been some vague attempt at a
steeple, which the prejudices of the community had cut short at the
belfry, and left without a spire, which gave the edifice a broad, flat
look, which would have driven a modern architect mad.</p>

<p>On the top of a broad platform, which rose half way to the ceiling, and
was approached by two steep flights of steps, was perched a little
sentry box of a pulpit, surmounted by something in the shape of a huge
toadstool, which the architects of that day called a sounding board.</p>

<p>In this pulpit, Sunday after Sunday, Mr. Prior, minister of the parish,
held forth after the good old fashion, when sermons had more heads than
a centipede has legs, and hearers got the value of the minister's salary
in good, sound gospel. Besides, Mr. Prior had other sources of
popularity&mdash;his doctrine was sound, and his sentences offered rare
opportunities for short snoozes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span> which came oftenest between seventhly
and eighthly, or thereabout. Not that minister Prior was dull&mdash;nothing
of the kind; he was a very learned man, educated solemnly in a gloomy
college, and lifted so completely out of the world during his clerical
studies that he never quite found his way back again.</p>

<p>After Mr. Prior had settled himself in the ministry some ten or fifteen
years, he married the most accomplished and correct person of all that
region, a lady who had kept the district school, to general acceptance,
six consecutive summers, had embroidered a cover for the communion table
with her own hands, and was only prevented adding a gorgeous book mark
and a pair of slippers for the minister, by the fear of what people
might say.</p>

<p>I think it was one of his deacons who first put a vague idea of
matrimony in the minister's head. One day the two were standing on a
little swell of ground which overlooked the juncture of the mountain
rivulet and the river. The clump of golden willows looked beautiful that
morning; the yellow boughs and twigs glanced in the sunshine, and the
thick leaves were all in a quiver under the kisses of the wind. Have I
said that the brook clove one of the greenest meadows you ever set eyes
on, before it crossed the road? If not, understand that pleasant fact
now, and more, that groups of trees had been left near the brook, all
along its banks, and one of its grand curves hedged in the loveliest
spot for a house your imagination ever dwelt upon.</p>

<p>"I say, minister," said the deacon&mdash;this was some time before our story,
remember&mdash;"I say, what if you get married, and settle down in that ere
meadow?"</p>

<p>The minister blushed, and looked, as the deacon afterward said, every
which way, before he answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
"Me marry, Deacon Smith; me!"</p>

<p>"And why not? there's acres of Scripture for it, and not one word agin
it; for how could St. Paul know any thing about it, never having had
experience like us married men?"</p>

<p>"Us married men," how strange the words sounded. "Us married men." The
minister turned the bow of his white cravat more in front and settled
himself complacently in his rusty black clothes. "Us married men."</p>

<p>"We talked about it in vestry meeting t'other night, and the notion
seemed to take wonderfully. We all agreed to a T about the person, but
our land for a home lot, building the house, and all that, was rather a
puzzler."</p>

<p>"I should think so," said the minister, taking out a broad silk
handkerchief, and wiping his forehead, which was getting crimson again.
"Then you agreed on&mdash;on&mdash;on the person."</p>

<p>"Unanimous," answered the deacon. "Not a dissenting voice."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, of course you've the best right of anybody to know first. It's
Miss Bruce&mdash;salt of the earth&mdash;salt of the earth, minister."</p>

<p>"You think so?" said the pastor, meekly.</p>

<p>"We know it; trust the vestry for discretion and sound judgment too.
Isn't that a building spot, now."</p>

<p>"Beautiful," said the minister, in a confused way; "but the lady, did
you ask her?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly; agreed to put it to vote first. Then I promised to inform
you of the sense of the meeting, and brother Wells will speak to Miss
Bruce. It's all settled before this time, I dare say."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
The minister drew a deep breath, as if he had just come out of a shower
bath, and then, his vision being cleared, took a survey of the meadow
lot. The deacon saw how his attention was directed, and went on.</p>

<p>"I agreed to give the lot, the hull meadow, understand. Deacon Styles
will find the timber, and the rest'll be divided up, sort of ginerally,
among the congregation. Then the women folks are going to get up
quiltings, and spinning frolics, and so on. In about three months, I
reckon, all will be ready."</p>

<p>Again the minister gave a shower bath gasp.</p>

<p>"There is brother Wells coming now, on his black horse, all fixed up in
his Sunday clothes," cried the deacon, triumphantly.</p>

<p>The brother rode up, looking as if he had something portentous on his
mind. "Well," said the deacon, "how did you get along, brother Wells?"</p>

<p>"Tolerably, tolerably; she was a little sot on having the minister come
over himself, but when I told her it was the solemn sense of the vestry,
of course she gave in."</p>

<p>"And she&mdash;no objections," said the minister.</p>

<p>"Objections!" cried both the men at once, "how could she?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know," answered the pastor. "That is, I didn't know but
she might think it a little sudden."</p>

<p>"Sudden! why it has been on our minds a whole year. It isn't just the
thing for our minister to be boarding about like a schoolmaster. A
servant of the Lord should set under his own vine and fig tree."</p>

<p>The minister wiped his face again, and cast a glance toward the meadow,
which began to look like home already.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
"I stopped at the saw-mill and bespoke the timber," said brother Wells;
"so if you'd just as lief, we'll go down and pick out the exact spot."</p>

<p>A smile glowed out on the minister's face. The deacons saw it, and
nodded pleasantly one to the other.</p>

<p>"Minister," said Wells, leaning down from his horse, "if you should take
a notion to go over yonder any time afore the house is built, just
consider this ere black horse as your own."</p>

<p>"Thank you kindly, brother."</p>

<p>"And," said Deacon French, "I stopped at the tailor's coming along; he's
got a firstrate piece of English broadcloth, but he says
it's seven years since you have been measured, minister, and to make a
good fit you'll have to go again."</p>

<p>"Doubtless&mdash;doubtless!" answered the minister, ready to cry under all
this goodness&mdash;a house, a wife, and a new suit of clothes all at once!
It really was too much of a mercy; he didn't know how to be thankful
enough.</p>

<p>Well, they went down to the meadow, selected a lovely spot for the
house, and stopped at the tailor's on their way home. That very week a
little boy came over to Deacon Wells, and asked, in a mysterious way, if
he would let the minister have his black horse to ride over the hill.</p>

<p>Deacon Wells smiled grimly, and brought out the horse himself, taking
great pains to tighten the saddle girth and shorten the stirrup leathers
properly, before he gave the bridle into the boy's hand.</p>

<p>It wasn't the last time that black horse was sent for to go over the
hill, and the result exhibited itself, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span> course of a few months,
in a pretty, white house, with a porch and dormer windows, standing in
the greenest curve of the brook; a thicket of wild roses, only half
shutting out a view of the water; ducks were swimming up and down the
little stream, and a flock of hens running riot in the meadow grass.
Besides this, a neat, little body, with the quaintest bonnet and neatest
dress in the world, came into the meeting-house with the minister, who
appeared in a new suit of black, separated from him in the broad aisle
in front of the deacon's seat, and while he mounted the pulpit stairs,
she turned into a side pew, and listened to his discourse, from
beginning to end, with unbroken interest.</p>

<p>But it is the weakness of vestry-men to vote money which they have not
the power to collect. The minister was married, and his house built, but
a debt lay on it, which troubled him as only studious men can be
troubled by monied claims.</p>

<p>The little wife came to his aid. She was a highly accomplished, well
educated woman, who had earned her own living from early girlhood, and
was not ashamed or afraid to help her husband in any womanly fashion
that presented itself. She had plenty of room, good health, and a clear
brain, all sources of usefulness, which she was prompt to put into
action. Teaching was her business. If she could obtain a couple of
boarding scholars into her own house, at city prices, the debts upon
their home would soon be removed.</p>

<p>The dainty little housewife began to talk with her husband about the
project one morning just as he was resolving the fifth head of his next
sermon, at which time he never heard a syllable addressed to him by any
mortal being, but always assented blandly to every thing proposed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
So, under the full conviction that he approved her plan, she wrote to a
friend in New York, requesting her to aid in obtaining the desired
pupils.</p>

<p>When his sermon was over, the minister received the news of this
arrangement with considerable astonishment, but he submitted without
protest, as the letter had already gone.</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="xxii" id="xxii"></a>CHAPTER XXII.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">THE MINISTER'S WIFE TAKES PUPILS.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Bays Hollow</span> stands on the very boundary line which separates Connecticut
from New York. Half the valley was in one State, half in the other; but
the minister's house, in fact the whole village, lay in Connecticut.
Persons acquainted with the geography of that part of the country, will
understand that the easiest mode of access to this place before
railroads threw their iron belts from State to State, was by the Hudson
river. Indeed, between New York and the minister's house, there was
scarcely half a day's land travel, and that was easily accomplished in a
stage-coach that ran twice a week from the river.</p>

<p>One night, it was late in the autumn, this stage-coach stopped at the
minister's house, and after great trampling of horses, crashing of iron
steps, and unhooking of straps, a lady was assisted out. Her trunk was
set on the turf, a basket, and after that, a charming little girl was
lifted through the door; bang&mdash;crash&mdash;a shout to the horses, and off the
stage thundered, arousing the whole neighborhood with its noise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Mrs. Prior came out with a white sun bonnet shading her modest face, and
a tidy, black apron tied over her calico dress. The rich travelling
costume of the lady, her stately beauty, joined with a haughty pride of
carriage, impressed her greatly. The little girl was, no doubt, to be
her pupil. What a lovely little fairy she was, with her blue eyes so
full of light, and her curls falling in waves and dancing in ringlets
over her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Is it Mrs. Prior?" inquired the traveller, with a sort of unpleasant
politeness. "Your friend in New York recommended this as a quiet place
where I and my daughter could be made comfortable for a few months."</p>

<p>"Yes, madame," said the lady, somewhat disturbed; "I desired scholars,
not boarders only."</p>

<p>"And I bring you scholars, madame."</p>

<p>"One&mdash;yes, I see, and a sweet creature she is," said the minister's
wife, looking at the little girl, who was drawing slowly toward her.</p>

<p>"More than one," answered the lady, blushing crimson; "I wish to study
myself, partly to encourage the child, partly because I require lessons
almost as much as she does."</p>

<p>"You, lady?"</p>

<p>"No matter about explanations. I have really come to be your pupil with
my daughter; my education is deficient&mdash;I wish to learn. I am a widow,
and quiet is good for me. I am quick, have a fine memory, and am willing
to study hard. This is my object in coming&mdash;will you take me?"</p>

<p>"If you wish it, certainly; but we are plain people&mdash;the minister and I;
our way of living may not suit you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
"Do not trouble yourself about that. I shall content myself with
anything; it is knowledge I came after."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I suppose my friend said something about terms," faltered the
minister's wife, blushing.</p>

<p>"Certainly; but that was for children; of course I shall be more
trouble. If I pay you just as much again will it answer?"</p>

<p>"It would be wrong to take it."</p>

<p>"Not at all; so if you will have the trunks carried in we can settle the
terms comfortably. I am ready to pay half the sum in advance, and
commence study at once."</p>

<p>Mrs. Prior called the hired girl to help carry in the trunks, and led
the way into the parlor. Mr. Prior passed them in the hall and made one
of his solemnly polite bows. The visitor answered it with a sweeping
salutation, and entered the parlor a little discomfited.</p>

<p>"Your husband is a clergyman, as I understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he is the minister here; I hope you will like him."</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly."</p>

<p>The lady placed her travelling basket on the table, and opening it took
out a heavy purse. Pouring out a quantity of gold she divided it without
counting and pushed it toward Mrs. Prior.</p>

<p>"This will be sufficient to commence with, I fancy."</p>

<p>Mrs. Prior looked at the little pile of Louis d'or in absolute
consternation. In her whole life she had never seen so much gold.</p>

<p>"It is good money," said the lady.</p>

<p>"Yes, doubtless," answered the minister's wife, examining a piece of
gold. "French coin."</p>

<p>"You read French, then?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
"Oh, yes."</p>

<p>"And can teach it?"</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"And how long will it take me to learn?"</p>

<p>"That depends on the&mdash;the powers of application you possess."</p>

<p>"Oh, never fear, I accomplish all I undertake&mdash;music too?"</p>

<p>"I have no instrument."</p>

<p>"But you can teach music?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then if there is an instrument to be got we will have it. This is a
nice, airy room, and a little more furniture would not hurt it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Prior was busy counting the gold; her face flushed, and she made
sad mistakes.</p>

<p>"This is too much," she said. "It would cover board and tuition for a
year."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps we shall stay so long."</p>

<p>"But even then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The lady made an impatient gesture.</p>

<p>"Pray don't trouble me about the money. If it is enough, well&mdash;if not, I
will give you more."</p>

<p>Here the minister came in. His wife moved toward him with the gold in
her hands.</p>

<p>"See what the Lord has done for us through this lady," she said.</p>

<p>He glanced at the gold, smiled benignly, and with gentle politeness
inquired the lady's name.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Mason&mdash;Ellen Mason, of South Carolina," she answered, coloring as
she spoke. "Rose, my dear, come and shake hands with the gentleman."</p>

<p>Rose shut the fanciful little basket that she carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span> on her arm and
came forward smiling in all her features; but as she stood on tiptoe
pursing her pretty mouth like a rosebud, her mother took up the basket.
The little girl saw it, broke away from the minister's hold and ran
back, crying out:</p>

<p>"Oh, ma&mdash;ma! take care or you'll break my string of robins' eggs!"</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="xxiii" id="xxiii"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">THE VILLAGE DOCTOR IN A SNOW-STORM.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Snow</span>! deep, deep snow everywhere! It lay three feet on a level in the
river vale. It spread a shining crust over the hills. It lodged in the
branches of the densely green pine woods, and whitened the roof of every
house in the neighborhood. The burying-ground on the hill, was wrapped
so deep in a fleecy shroud, that you could hardly distinguish the marble
grave-stones from its white surface, and the church, always a beautiful
object, with its slender steeple and white walls, looked like a temple
wrought from the snow itself&mdash;something that the angels had visited
overnight, and left spotless as themselves.</p>

<p>With all this depth and volume of snow, crusted over as it had been by a
sharp frost, it was almost impossible that the roads could be broken in
a single day. Still, a few ox sleds had marked out the line of the
turnpike, and some sleighs had followed in their track, with a wrangle
of bells that told of the struggle made by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span> smoking horses which
drew them. On the bank of the river, on the Chewstown side, the highway
runs along the side of a hill, which terminates abruptly at the bridge,
where the New Haven turnpike intersects it.</p>

<p>There is nothing very beautiful about the spot now, for the hemlocks,
and young tamarisks are all cut down, the dog-wood and shad-blossoms
cleared away, and the hill is almost left without a shade. But at the
time of this snow-storm, the naked boughs and evergreens proved how
thick and green the summer shadows must be, and if the "Rock Spring"
sent its waters flashing through the snow, melting it softly away, you
could, at least, imagine how cool and bright they were when ferns,
mosses, and violets crept into the turf, and covered the rocks with the
green and azure of a spring birth.</p>

<p>This road was not generally so much travelled as the one across the sand
banks, but two or three loads of wood had passed that way, revealing the
depths of the drifts without rendering them much more passable. Still a
"solitary horseman" came out from the shelter of the hemlocks, and made
his way very slowly toward the bridge. His horse, a stout animal, with
any amount of mane and foretop streaming in the wind, came tramping
heavily through the snow, emitting clouds of steam from his sides, while
each labored breath bearded his under lip with icicles, and fringed his
dilating nostrils with quivering frost-work.</p>

<p>The man who had braved that almost impassable road and cold day, was one
of the most remarkable personages known in that portion of the country.
His very eccentricities gave force and vitality to the general regard.
Singular in person, singular in character, unlike all other men in
almost every particular, he was, perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span> somewhat for this very
reason, looked up to and reverenced as the peculiar property of the
neighborhood. Learned he certainly was; and neither before or after has
another man been found who could, in all things, pretend to fill his
place.</p>

<p>This man was the village doctor; no, the district doctor, rather, for
his ride extended over thirty miles, and as a consulting physician over
the whole State. With a huge bear-skin cap upon his head, and an ample
brown overcoat, girded to his waist by a broad leather belt, and falling
low on each side of his horse, he issued from behind the trees. Two
crutches, worn smooth as glass, were crossed before him on the saddle
bow. He held the bridle loosely in his hands and encouraged the horse
with many a droll saying, as if the animal were human and could enjoy
his quaint humor. At the "Rock Spring" there was a struggle between the
doctor and his steed. For an unknown number of years the horse had
invariably quenched his thirst in that particular place, and he was
determined not to make this day an exception, though a deep round hole,
scarcely larger than the doctor's cap, and a moist sinking of the snow
across the road might have deceived a less sagacious animal into a
belief that this old drinking place had been swallowed up by the storm.</p>

<p>There was no deceiving our doctor's brown horse in any thing, much less
in a case of appetite like that. He was a dainty animal in the matter of
drink, and water so pure and crystaline as that which lost its smothered
music in the snow, was not to be found within twenty miles.</p>

<p>The doctor was in haste, or he never would have dreamed of contesting
any thing with his faithful steed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span> Indeed, the case must have been one
of life or death which could bring any man on the highway at a time like
that. He began to protest and reason with the horse after his eccentric
fashion, and finally went so far as to gather up the bridle and tighten
the bit, a procedure which so astonished the horse that he backed
sideways into a drift, viciously slanted his ears, and subsided into a
state of masterly inactivity, the most difficult thing to conquer that
we know of, either in statesmanship or horseflesh.</p>

<p>The doctor chuckled, laid the bridle down caressingly on the neck that
had made a lamentable failure in striving to arch itself, and folding
his hands in the loose sleeves of his overdress, waited. Obstinate
animals and obstinate men are apt to feel as if fighting the air when no
one opposes them. The horse began to realize this sensation. The
snow-drift into which he had backed was cold and deep. The waters of the
spring murmured a soft enticement. First, he pointed one ear and turned
his head with sly, compunctious timidity, as if ashamed to enjoy his own
triumph. Then he pointed the other ear, shook himself a little, tramped
heavily toward the spring, and thrusting his head deep into the snow,
began to drink.</p>

<p>The doctor indulged in a laugh, and when the horse withdrew his head,
shaking a storm of drops back into the spring, he patted him softly,
called him a good fellow for having his own way, and appeared so much
like the obliged party that the animal, to his dying hour, was never
quite certain of his own triumph.</p>

<p>After all, this struggle had taken but little time. The horse breasted
his work with fresh vigor after it. He pushed through and trampled down
the snow until he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span> reached the bridge, stalked over it, toiled through
the valley and up Falls Hill, never stopping till he reached the huge
willow tree which stood on the crossroad that led to Bungy. This was a
farming district, back of Castle Rock, where the Thrasher farm and Mrs.
Allen's place lay.</p>

<p>While the doctor was breathing his horse under the willow, a teamster
passed with a large sled, on which some bags of grain were piled. He
stopped his oxen with a flourish of the goad, and a storm of
who&mdash;who-o-as, while he held a little conversation.</p>

<p>"Tough teaming this!" he said. "Hard on young cattle; but somebody must
go first. Any of the neighbors dangerous out this way, doctor?"</p>

<p>"No," answered the doctor, with a twinkle of the eye.</p>

<p>"Then what on arth brings you out?"</p>

<p>"Wanted a ride, and thought perhaps I could hunt up a patient."</p>

<p>"Wal, now I shouldn't a thought it! Which way are you a going, if I may
be so bold?"</p>

<p>"Haven't decided. If you've got a copper in your pocket, toss up. It's
all the same to me."</p>

<p>The man took a new cent from his pocket, and balancing it on his thumb
nail, he called out&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Which'll ye have, doctor?"</p>

<p>"Heads."</p>

<p>Up flashed the cent into the sunshine, then down to the teamster's feet,
where it made a deep, round hole in the snow.</p>

<p>"Heads it is, doctor," cried the man, fishing his coin up in a handful
of flakes.</p>

<p>"True enough! then I will ride over the hill. That toss up decides it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
"You'll never get there, doctor; drifts over your head."</p>

<p>The doctor was ploughing his way up the Bungy road, and did not seem to
hear this prediction. He was evidently very anxious to go forward, and
encouraged his horse with sharp ejaculations, as they approached the
hills. The animal understood it all, and lending himself to the work,
stamped and pursued his way onward with the perseverance of a veteran;
but his progress was necessarily slow, and the doctor's broad forehead
gathered into an anxious frown under his cap.</p>

<p>"Poor thing&mdash;poor thing&mdash;she may be dead before we get there," he
muttered more than once, and then he would commence expostulating with
the horse, who, good fellow, was doing his very best. Just as they were
ascending the brow of the hill, a woman was seen in advance, wildly
pushing her way through the snow. She saw the doctor, and waved her arms
in distracted haste, beckoning him to come on.</p>

<p>The doctor must have been insane with anxiety to have ventured on it.
But he seized one of his crutches and gave the horse a back-handed blow.
A plunge that almost unseated the imprudent man&mdash;a storm of snow about
his ears, and the animal broke into one of the most extraordinary gaits
that ever a horseman experienced&mdash;backing down, rushing forward, and
making side movements that came very near landing the doctor head
foremost in a huge wave-like drift that covered the fence close by to
its topmost rail.</p>

<p>At last, with great coaxing and expostulation, this state of things was
reduced to the most awkward attempt at a trot, which the exasperated
animal persisted in, though his efforts were broken up at every other
step.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
The woman stood for a minute knee-deep in the snow. She only ceased
wringing her hands to beckon him forward. When certain that he was doing
his best, she turned and walked quickly up the road, and entered Mrs.
Allen's house.</p>

<p>"I thought so&mdash;I feared it," muttered the doctor, "but who ever saw
riding like this? It's like wading through a desert of cotton wool.
Don't you think so, old fellow?"</p>

<p>The horse was indignant yet, and scorned to give any sign that he
understood those conciliatory tones, even by a twinkle of the ear. On he
scrambled, deeply injured in his feelings, but resolved to do his duty,
and leave the rest on his master's conscience.</p>

<p>At last they reached the gate which led to Mrs. Allen's house. With his
crutches making deep holes in the snow at every step, the doctor made
for the door, which was opened hurriedly, and Mrs. Allen stood pale as
death, with a wild light in her eyes, waiting for him to come in.</p>

<p>The door was closed, and only opened for a moment for the pale, stern
woman to come forth, with a blanket in her arms, which she threw over
the smoking horse, and went in again.</p>

<p>Then a dead, heavy blank came upon the house, and all that surrounded
it. The horse fell into a doze under his blanket. Not a living thing was
in view, nothing but the dreary white bosom of the earth, and a soft
curl of smoke that rose from the Thrasher homestead, which was itself
invisible, a little farther over the hill, though the naked twigs of the
poplar trees in front could be seen against the sky. Once, the horse
started, and pointed his ears, as if some familiar sound had reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
him, but his head drooped again directly. The sound, if any had troubled
him, was so indistinct that he rejected it as a delusion. When the
doctor came out, it was with a thoughtful, anxious look that seldom
visited his face. No one followed him to the door, and he sighed heavily
while climbing to his seat on the saddle.</p>

<p>On his way home the doctor met several persons, who in the kind-hearted
curiosity usual to the place, inquired who was sick enough to call him
out in such terrible weather. He answered, with quizzical gravity, that
he had been to visit old Mr. Lane over the hill, a man of ninety, who
was suffering dreadfully with the whooping-cough.</p>

<p>"The whooping-cough, and he full ninety&mdash;why I never heard of such a
thing," said one of the questioners; "I thought nothing but children
ever had that disease."</p>

<p>"True enough; but you forget that old Mr. Lane is in his second
childhood," answered the doctor.</p>

<p>The man's face brightened.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he said, "that accounts for it. I never thought of the
second childhood. Does the old chap whoop much?"</p>

<p>"Awfully, awfully! Good-day!" and the doctor rode on, chuckling
pleasantly to his horse; but the gleam of humor soon died from his
features, and they grew anxious again&mdash;so anxious, that you might have
fancied that his visit had been to a death-bed.</p>

<a name="xxiv" id="xxiv"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">THE GRANDMOTHER RELENTING.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> widow Allen sat by her kitchen fire, and a sterner, sadder woman
never drew breath than she appeared on the day after that stormy visit
from the doctor. She was waiting for him now. Her eyes, full of sullen
thought, dwelt on the fire. Her feet were planted hard on the
hearth&mdash;every thing about her looked unyielding and stiff&mdash;the
high-backed chair, the full borders of her cap, and the white kerchief
folded over her bosom&mdash;the very grief in her features seemed frozen
there.</p>

<p>"Mother!"</p>

<p>This voice came from an inner room, the one which Mrs. Allen had
occupied during her sickness. Its faint sweetness drew the old woman
from her sombre mood. She arose and entered the apartment where her
daughter lay.</p>

<p>The room was dimly lighted, for besides the usual blinds, a patch-work
quilt, glowing with gorgeous colors, had been stretched across the only
window it contained. As a great proportion of scarlet and green
predominated in the quilt, it gave a richness to the atmosphere somewhat
like that which streams through stained glass in a chancel window.</p>

<p>Katharine lay upon the bed among pillows, white as the snow drifting
outside, and with a pretty cap shading her delicate features.</p>

<p>"Did you call, Katharine?" questioned the mother, in her clear, cold
way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
"Yes, mother; my head begins to ache. A little while ago I was cold, now
hot flushes are running all over me. Is this fever, do you think?"</p>

<p>The old woman lifted a corner of the quilt from over the window, and
looked in her daughter's face.</p>

<p>Katharine shrunk from the glance.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, don't look at me so&mdash;it makes me tremble!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen dropped the quilt, and, ignoring the fears of her child,
answered to the first question.</p>

<p>"You are getting excited, but I think not feverish."</p>

<p>"Mother."</p>

<p>"Well, Katharine."</p>

<p>"I want&mdash;I wish&mdash;"</p>

<p>The poor thing made an effort to pull down the bed-clothes, but her hand
trembled so violently that she could only make a faint signal before it
fell.</p>

<p>The mother was touched. What woman, however aggrieved, would have
resisted those mournful eyes? She went close to the bed, and turned down
the blanket. A babe lay sleeping on that young creature's bosom, its
little hand resting like a rose leaf, on her neck. A cloud of soft,
golden hair covered its head. Mrs. Allen turned her face away, but the
magnetism of those blue eyes drew it softly toward the child.</p>

<p>"You are its grandmother&mdash;and oh, tell me if I am your child yet?"</p>

<p>The young creature began to tremble as she uttered these words. This
disturbed the infant, and the grandmother found a pair of soft, dreamy
eyes looking into hers. The angels who guard little children may have
thrown a heavenly earnestness into the child's look; I do not know&mdash;but
it touched that stern heart more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span> the young mother's appeal had
done. She stooped and took the babe in her arms; a thousand sweet,
maternal recollections rose in her bosom as she pillowed it there, and
laid her face against its velvet cheek.</p>

<p>Katharine smiled. "Mother, is it like me&mdash;like what I was once?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The woman could not utter another word. When a rock is cleft, the
fragments half choke up the waters that gush through them.</p>

<p>"Mother, my head troubles me, and I'm afraid if fever comes I may lose
my senses; but I know every thing now, and want you to believe me. All
that I have told you is true. It isn't because I am ashamed, but he will
be here in a few days&mdash;I am sure of that. It is now more than three
months, and he promised solemnly to come by that time. This is why we
must not say any thing to the neighbors; they might not credit me, you
know; but when he is here, who will dare turn against me? You believe
that we are married, dear mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe it, Katharine."</p>

<p>"If I should be worse, you will find the paper in the garret, between
one of the rafters and the shingles. Nobody must be allowed to say a
word against this child when I am dead."</p>

<p>"Nor against <i>my</i> child while I live!" answered Mrs. Allen. "For this
reason, it must be made known in the neighborhood that you are that
man's wife."</p>

<p>"Not quite yet. It will be time enough when some one comes," pleaded the
young creature. "Nelson may be on the road now. The doctor won't tell,
he promised me."</p>

<p>She was getting excited with opposition; her cheeks were scarlet. The
soft blue eyes began to glitter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
"Promise, mother! It kills me to think what the neighbors will say; but
when he comes, I shall be so proud to take my baby in my
arms&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;" She broke off, and lifting one hand to her head, began
waving it to and fro.</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen saw that there was great danger in this agitation, and
attempted to soothe it.</p>

<p>"Promise not to tell! promise not to tell!" cried the invalid, panting
for breath, and moving restlessly on her pillow.</p>

<p>"Yes, Katharine; I promise not to say any thing for a week at least."</p>

<p>"He will be here in a week! he will be here in a week."</p>

<p>Katharine kept whispering this over and over again, until she fell
asleep from pure exhaustion. It was some time before the crimson flush
left her face, or the quick breath subsided to the calm respiration that
followed; but at last she slept tranquilly as the infant which still lay
on its grandmother's bosom.</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen sat down by the kitchen fire. She could not find it in her
heart to put the babe away after its little face had once touched her
own. Seating herself in the high-backed chair, she began rocking to and
fro&mdash;and as the love of that little child crept, like a perfume, to her
heart, hatred to its father slowly disappeared, as a kingly essence
destroys all evil odors. She began to think how pleasant it would be to
live in closer connection with the good old couple over the hill, and
how much she had to be thankful for, that her daughter was not, in fact,
the outcast she had almost believed her. As this spirit of gratitude
took possession of her heart, she began to hum over a cradle song, which
had almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span> died out of her memory, and tender dews stole into her eyes,
of which she was quite unconscious, until the fire began to look hazy
under her steady glance.</p>

<p>Our God uses little children as instruments of great tenderness. They
want no key to the hardest heart; but go in, without knocking, and
nestle themselves like birds in a strange nest, carrying gentleness and
blessings with them. So it was with this little mite of humanity. In the
helplessness of its animal life, it appealed to the stern woman's heart
without challenging the stubborn pride that nothing could conquer. So
she softened down, and from touching the little face, began to kiss it,
and finally converted her lap into a cradle and commenced trotting the
baby on her knees with the most womanly gentleness.</p>

<p>The doctor found her in this condition when he came in the afternoon.
Katharine was still asleep, and the two held a confidential talk on the
hearth-stone, in which the young creature's condition was thoroughly
discussed. When told of the great dread which the young mother felt
regarding any present publicity being given to her marriage, or the
existence of the child, the doctor rather sided with that view of the
question.</p>

<p>"The truth is," he said, "we should have gossip and questions, guesses
and scandal, running through the neighborhood like wildfire. Let the
young fellow come back and settle the whole matter for himself. There is
no reason on earth why you should see company. Besides, the state of the
roads will keep everybody away."</p>

<p>"I never have much company, and don't want any just now; as for
explaining what&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is nobody's business; why, it's just what you dislike, and the thought
of it has, by your own account,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span> driven the young creature half beside
herself. Just let the thing alone, Mrs. Allen; where there is no one to
talk with, there is nothing to tell."</p>

<p>"I will neither seek my neighbors, nor withhold the truth if they demand
it of me," said the widow.</p>

<p>The doctor gathered up his crutches, with a show of impatience, and
muttered something not over complimentary to the sea, and all that
followed it.</p>

<p>His voice aroused the patient in the next room, who called out:</p>

<p>"Who is there, mother? Has he come?"</p>

<p>The doctor stumped across the room, and stood balanced on his crutches
looking at her.</p>

<p>"Oh, is it you, doctor?" she said, in a voice that plainly spoke the
disappointment that she felt.</p>

<p>"Well, it seems impossible to mistake myself for anybody else, or I
should deny being fool enough to come this road twice."</p>

<p>"But you are here. It is very, very kind. You don't know how much I feel
it; besides, I want to say something."</p>

<p>"Never mind, I know what it is; have been talking it over in the next
room. Want to be quiet, natural; sick people always do. Hate to have a
lot of old women screeching over the baby, and asking questions enough
to drive a Christian mother into Bedlam&mdash;natural again, why not?
nuisance&mdash;women ought to be prohibited as a sex by act of Congress&mdash;a
few exceptions, no doubt; but patriotic women are ready to be flung
overboard for the general good."</p>

<p>Katharine looked a little bewildered, and quite weary. She was thinking
about her own troubles, and had not strength enough for any thing else.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
"Did any one ask you about us, doctor?"</p>

<p>"About you? no&mdash;about where I was going, fifty."</p>

<p>"And you told them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course I told 'em; why not?"</p>

<p>Katharine turned very white, and gasped for breath.</p>

<p>"You told them about me&mdash;about my baby?"</p>

<p>"Bah child, no; but I told 'em old Lane had caught the whooping-cough,
and that will keep the whole town in gossip at least a week."</p>

<p>Katharine began to laugh&mdash;she was but a young thing, and the idea amused
her excessively.</p>

<p>"Stop that, or it'll end in hysterics," he said, frowning upon her with
comical affectation; but she smiled yet, and her pale cheek flushed.
Still, the anxieties that pressed upon her were too real, and she became
grave again.</p>

<p>"You wont say anything about it, please," she murmured. "The minute he
comes, they shall know everything. I'm not very strong; if it wasn't for
that you should read the certificate now; but it's up-stairs, and so we
must wait."</p>

<p>"Never mind, my little Katy-did, I can wait, and so shall the rest of
them; never fear."</p>

<p>"You're very good!" murmured Katharine, faintly; "I shall sleep without
dreaming such frightful things after this."</p>

<p>She closed her eyes a moment, and then opened them with a start.</p>

<p>"Where's the baby?"</p>

<p>"In your mother's lap&mdash;don't you hear her buzzing over it like a bumble
bee?"</p>

<p>"Is it&mdash;is that her?" whispered the young mother, and a beautiful smile
stole into her eyes. "I don't remember ever hearing her sing before."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
"Oh, she'll soon break in&mdash;no fool like a grandmother."</p>

<p>"How pleasant it sounds," murmured the young mother, listening to the
low hum which came from the next room, and ignoring the doctor's speech
entirely. "I didn't know mother's voice was so sweet. It makes me
sleepy."</p>

<p>"Then shut your eyes and go to dreaming at once; a good sleep will do
you more good than I can," said the doctor, wheeling round on his
crutches, and stumping off into the next room. Here he gave Mrs. Allen a
quaint reprimand for allowing her patient to put herself into a fever,
and warned her that the next excitement might go to the brain and raise
the mischief. Then he chucked the baby under its mite of a chin, which
the little thing returned with an incipient hiccough instead of a smile,
which was altogether beyond its powers, after which he mounted his horse
and rode off, chuckling over the mystifications which all questioners
were sure to get, on his way home.</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="xxv" id="xxv"></a>CHAPTER XXV.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">A GRAVE IN THE SNOW.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> chanced, during the week, that another fall of snow blocked up the
roads just as they were getting well trodden down. This kept the people
in-doors, and Mrs. Allen was left to the entire solitude she so much
desired. The doctor only came once after the visit we have mentioned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
That time Mrs. Allen had been compelled to leave the house. Her firewood
was out, and she had gone in search of a neighbor who had promised her
to haul a load from the forest back of Castle Rock. The distance was
considerable, and the walking toilsome, beside the neighbor she sought
had gone out after his team and she was compelled to wait.</p>

<p>It was during her absence that the doctor went to the house. He found
Katharine improving; still excitable on the subject of her husband's
return, and listening for his step at every movement, but apparently so
happy with the growth of her child, that even this craving wish could
not materially impede her well-doing.</p>

<p>The doctor had a tedious ride before him, and only remained long enough
to be sure that there was really nothing to require his stay, and rode
off. He was in the more haste because dull, leaden clouds were gathering
in the sky, and fine snow came down at intervals, threatening a heavier
fall.</p>

<p>On his way down the hill he met the town carrier, a man who distributed
papers, and transported parcels for the whole neighborhood, to and from
New Haven, twice each week. Sometimes he brought letters from the
post-office. Indeed, from a three cent whistle to a dressed pig in
killing time, he refused nothing that came within the capacity of his
one-horse wagon, or could be sheltered by its oil-cloth cover. This man
nodded to the doctor, and after passing him, gave a little blast from
his tin horn to notify the next house that he was about to stop there.</p>

<p>This house was Mrs. Allen's. Katharine was in her room, and was ignorant
that her mother had not returned. She started up in bed at the first
sound of the horn, and cried out:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
"Run, mother, run. It is the carrier, he may bring news. Nelson has come
passenger. I'm sure of it!"</p>

<p>The carrier drew up before the house, and waited a minute for some one
to come forth. But no one
<a name="appeared" id="appeared"></a><ins title="Original has appeareed,">appeared</ins> and with an impatient
growl at the delay he jumped out of his wagon, opened the street door,
and flung a letter through, muttering that he would call for the postage
some other time, a storm was coming on, and he was late already.</p>

<p>Katharine saw the letter, gave a cry of joy, such as those humble walls
never heard again, and sprang to the floor, leaving her child asleep in
the bed. She seized the letter and tore it open; three or four bank
notes fluttered around her, falling unheeded, about the room. She strove
to read, but the paper rattled in her hands&mdash;dizzy and weak she could
not distinguish a word of the few that danced before her eyes. She went
back to the bed, seized one of the posts of the bedstead, and steadied
herself desperately.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Katharine, it cannot be helped, I am going on a whaling voyage;
nothing better presented itself, and I must not be idle. The
ship will be gone three years at least, perhaps more, but there
is a chance for making money. I send you all that has been
advanced to me; when that is gone go to my father, as I told
you.</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Nelson Thrasher.</span>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She grew blind. A dull, sickening weight fell upon her. She strove to
creep into bed, clambered to the edge upon her knees, and fell forward,
with her face pressed to the pillow, which settled slowly down, and
buried the sleeping child&mdash;a struggle&mdash;a faint, stifled sound&mdash;a
scarcely perceptible upheaving of the pillow, and all was still.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
There was no change in the mother; white as marble, she had fallen upon
her face&mdash;lifeless as marble she lay until the great clock in the
kitchen tolled the hour.</p>

<p>The struggle of her coming misery was terrible. She turned and sat upon
the bed, with her white feet hanging over the edge. The shawl which Mrs.
Allen had folded over her shoulders from fear of cold, hung loosely
adown her long night robe. She began to shiver, and drew it around her,
hugging it to her bosom, but some idea of its emptiness seized upon her.
She opened the shawl and looked down upon her flowing night dress
wonderingly, as if she had lost something. Then her eyes were turned
vaguely around the bed. She lifted a corner of the blanket, and finding
nothing, impatiently pushed the pillow aside.</p>

<p>There it lay&mdash;her little babe, asleep, and yet not asleep. Insane fire
flashed to her eyes; fever leaped, and burned in all her veins; angry
defiance blazed in her face. She was stunned before, but maddened now.
Somebody had been trying to kill her babe with too much warmth. Her
mother had done it. Her stern mother, who never would forgive, and had
always hated the Thrasher blood. She would come back and try again. How
flushed and hot its little face looked. How menacingly its tiny fist was
clenched. Something very cruel must have been done before it came to
that. How soundly she had slept to know nothing of this. But her mother
should never harm it again. She knew of a nice cool place under the
great butternut where it could have a beautiful blanket of snow, with
light icicles shimmering over it from the branches. Nobody could find it
there, and that strange look of pain would change to quiet sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Prompted by these insane thoughts, the young mother seized her child,
folded it closely to her bosom, under the shawl, and fled from the
house. She hurried on, her white feet sinking in the snow at every step.
The crust cut her ankles, but she was unaware of the pain. The wind
whistled through her night dress, but she only laughed&mdash;its sharpness
would drive that terrible red from her baby's face. She clambered the
stone wall twice, into the orchard, and across another lot, until she
reached the rock beneath the butternut branches, now without a leaf.</p>

<p>A shelf of the rock shot out from the drift that almost buried it. She
took off her shawl, wrapped it tenderly about the child, laid it on this
shelf, and began to work. She tore the glittering crust away, fell upon
her knees, and commenced hurling the loose snow out with her hands,
until a cradle was scooped in the drift. Then she gathered up an armful
of the flakes, moulded and patted them into a pillow, and hushing the
baby in her arms a moment, laid it down. She covered it with a soft
blanket of snow, placed the icy crust carefully over it, and then
stopped, and looked about bewildered, as if wondering what she could do
next.</p>

<p>By this time the cold had pierced her to the vitals, but the fever met
it fiercely and shook that delicate form like a reed. She sat down on
the rock, gazing at the little white grave, as if she had just buried
her heart there; and was afraid that some one would trample on it. The
cold was doing its work; a few moments more and she would never have
left the rock again. But some imaginary noise frightened her. She
started up, forgot every thing, and flew toward the house&mdash;the light
hair floating back from under her cap, and her thin garments fluttering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
through the atmosphere like shadows. The door was partly open&mdash;she
darted in, crossed the kitchen, and springing to the centre of her bed,
covered herself up with the clothes, shuddering and laughing in the same
breath.</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="xxvi" id="xxvi"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">A CROWD UNDER THE BUTTERNUT TREE.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> last the old woman came in. With the sly instincts of insanity,
Katharine lay still, holding the blankets over her head, pretending to
be asleep.</p>

<p>The old lady did not attempt to disturb her, but merely looked in to see
that all was quiet, and went to the kitchen. To her surprise, she found
the outer door open. The wind had swept in, scattering snow and ashes
over the floor. This had produced a draught down the wide-mouthed
chimney, and filled the room with smoke. Mrs. Allen threw up a sash,
which produced an eddy of wind and sent some loose papers flying toward
the hearth&mdash;one, which seemed to be a letter, floated by her and was
drawn up the chimney, catching fire as it went; another was following,
but she grasped it in time, and found that the flimsy bit of silk paper
was a bank bill of considerable amount. Two others she picked up from
the floor.</p>

<p>Who could have been in her house? How was it possible for so much money
to have found its way there? She went into the bedroom, resolved to
question Katharine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span> who heard her coming, and crouched under the
bedclothes.</p>

<p>"Katharine! Katharine!"</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>The old lady, fearing she scarcely knew what, went up to the bed and
turned down the clothes. There was a little resistance, and then
Katharine looked up with a frightened smile, trembling terribly either
with dread or cold.</p>

<p>"Who has been here since I went away, Katharine?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"But look! Where did all this money come from?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>And, indeed, she did not know, never having taken a thought of that
portion of Thrasher's letter; even the epistle itself only whirled
through the chaos of her mind, like dead leaves in a tempest.</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen examined the money again, while Katharine eyed her with the
sharp cunning of insanity.</p>

<p>"How you shake, child? The open door has given you a chill."</p>

<p>"It was too warm! too warm!" muttered the poor creature; "crimson hot,
crimson hot!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen was so surprised with the money that she did not heed the
strange murmur of her daughter. She put the bills away in an old teapot
in the corner cupboard. Then something struck her as unnatural in the
stillness of the room, and she went back again.</p>

<p>"Is the baby asleep yet?" she inquired, sitting down by the bed.</p>

<p>Katharine shrunk away from her; but answered in a quick, eager way:</p>

<p>"Yes; it sleeps sweetly, sweetly, sweetly."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
This strange repetition of one word drew Mrs. Allen's attention more
closely to the invalid. There was something strange in her face&mdash;a gleam
of vigilant cunning in the eyes that made the mother anxious.</p>

<p>"How soundly the little thing sleeps," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, soundly," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Move a little, and let me take it up."</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>A look of defiance came into that beautiful face. Katharine was resolved
to defend her secret to the last moment.</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen became frightened; forced the bedclothes from that feeble
grasp, and stooped down to search for the child.</p>

<p>It was gone!</p>

<p>"Where&mdash;oh, Katharine&mdash;where is the baby?"</p>

<p>A gleam of infinite craft stole into those blue eyes.</p>

<p>"What baby?"</p>

<p>"Yours, yours&mdash;our own little child! who has taken it away?"</p>

<p>"Nobody."</p>

<p>"Then where is it?"</p>

<p>"Asleep; didn't I tell you so?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen rushed into the kitchen and searched it in every corner. The
smoke had cleared away, and she discovered tracks of a small, naked foot
in the loose snow that had drifted into the room. Where was the child?
what could have happened? Mrs. Allen rushed distractedly into the
street, just as the neighbor whom she had been in search of drove up
with a load of wood on his sled.</p>

<p>"Hello! what's the matter, Mrs. Allen?" he called out, as she came
toward the gate, pale as death, and wringing her hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
"Our baby&mdash;my little grandchild&mdash;it is gone!"</p>

<p>The man stopped and emitted a low whistle.</p>

<p>"So there was something in all that talk," he muttered, "hard as I stood
up for her."</p>

<p>"I only left to run down to your house&mdash;we hadn't another armful of
wood. When I came back, the outdoor was open, the room full of smoke,
and she all alone! Oh, God help me, what can I do!"</p>

<p>"Just go into the house, and let us talk it all over," said the
kind-hearted farmer, leaving his oxen; "I don't understand."</p>

<p>"Oh, we cannot stop to talk&mdash;the child must be found. Isn't that Mr.
Stokes coming up the hill? Call him&mdash;we must search&mdash;we must find it."</p>

<p>The farmer called out for Mr. Stokes to hurry forward, and at the same
time ran to meet him. The two men stood talking together some minutes,
then came toward the house in company.</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen had gone back to her daughter, and with tears raining down
her face, was pleading with her. Poor woman! it was many years since she
had cried like that, but when an infant comes to a lonely house, the
fountain of tears is sure to swell afresh in the most stern bosom. The
sweet word, "grandmother," had been applied to her. The baby's little
heart had stirred against her own; without that child, all the stern
desolation of her life would come back again.</p>

<p>But Katharine could not answer.</p>

<p>The two men came in, looking curious and excited; their presence seemed
to strike Katharine dumb. She lay with her eyes wide open, staring at
them. A vague smile wandered on her lips as they questioned her, but no
words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Baffled and still anxious, the men went into the kitchen again, leaving
Mrs. Allen behind. They saw the tracks still imprinted on the floor, and
followed them with keen observation. The tracks continued out into the
yard, turned there, and led toward the orchard. One naked footprint was
stamped on the top of the stone wall, as if a leap had pressed it deeply
there. After this there was little trouble&mdash;broken places in the snow
crust led them on till they stood by the rock under the butternut tree.</p>

<p>It is strange how soon a crowd will collect, if any thing unusual is
going on, even in the remotest places. A good many people were on the
road, some going to the stores at Chewstown or Falls Hill, some taking
grists to mill, and others loitering on their way to the tavern, whose
red sign swung on the river road a little beyond Rock Spring.</p>

<p>Before the two men, who tracked that terrible path, had touched the
little white grave by the rock, some half-dozen persons had collected
around it. A feeling of awe kept the first comers from touching the
broken snow-crust; but now, a man in the crowd thrust it aside with his
foot, and the rest set to work.</p>

<p>It took but little time to remove the white covering beneath, and, after
a moment's work, the dead infant was found wrapped in a shawl, which was
recognized by more than one present as belonging to Katharine Allen.</p>

<p>A feeling of profound consternation fell upon the little group of
farmers, as they lifted the infant from its grave. The face, now pale
and cold, was all uncovered, flakes of snow trembled in the golden hair,
and the winds blew over it so sharply, that one of the men put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span> forth
his hand, and drew the shawl softly over its head, muttering, "God
forgive its mother!"</p>

<p>No funeral ever was marked with more solemn faces than those which
followed the dead infant back to the house. No word was spoken aloud,
but hoarse whispers passed from lip to lip, and the hardiest man there
shrunk from carrying that mournful burden into the presence of its
grandmother.</p>

<p>A terrible presentiment of the truth had fallen upon the old woman. She
had failed to win any thing from her daughter, and, with a sinking
heart, listened to the men crunching the snow under their feet, as they
went toward the orchard. For the world she could not have gone to the
door or remained upright upon her feet. The old high-back chair stood on
the hearth; she sat down. The fire flamed up and flickered over her
white features. Those little tracks upon the floor fascinated her gaze.
They melted and run into each other, taking uncouth shapes, but, in her
eyes, there had been no change. These two little footprints, in
disappearing from the floor, seemed to burn themselves into her heart.</p>

<p>She sat still listening, but there was no sound except the soughing of
the wind among the naked apple trees. Katharine lay still in her bed,
exulting in the safety which she had secured for her child, but craftily
silent lest some one should find out her secret. Filled with this idea
she held her breath, as if that would betray her.</p>

<p>Thus the stillness was profound. There was no confusion in the woman's
mind now. Her quick, clear intellect had seized upon the broad facts of
the case. She struggled against them, but the child was gone, and those
footprints on the floor were obliterating, but not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span> dried out. After a
time she heard a strange sound in the road&mdash;the heavy tramp of feet,
followed by suppressed voices near the gate. With a prayer to God she
arose, walked to the door, cast it wide open, and stood on the threshold
with her arms extended. It was like laying a dead child into a dead
woman's bosom when the man placed his burden in those arms.</p>

<h2><a name="xxvii" id="xxvii"></a>CHAPTER XXVII.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">THE SAILOR AND HIS TWO COMPANIONS.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> one of those common hotels, frequented by the better class of seamen
who enter New York, David Rice had taken up his quarters, accompanied by
little Paul and Jube. With the bravery of a Nelson, he had carried the
disabled brig safely into a Southern port, with her cargo all safe; an
act of heroism that had secured the warmest approbation of her owners,
and what was far better, an appointment to the command of the craft he
had saved.</p>

<p>While the repairs were going on, David, exultant and happy, had
proceeded with his two friends to the commercial emporium, where he
became sadly puzzled what course to take next, for two more simple
hearted and helpless creatures never existed.</p>

<p>"Now," said David, going into a select committee of one on the subject;
"now when a chap saves the life of another chap, big or little, and
turns his face about from a long voyage, where all is provided for, he's
in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span> duty bound to adopt that other chap, and take good care of him so
long as he can't take care of himself. Now that's just your case, David
Rice. What on arth can these poor critters do without you?
Nothing&mdash;that's sartin. What can you do for them?&mdash;there's the puzzler.
As for work, the nigger is strong as a lion; but he's used to hot
weather, and a cold snap curls him right up. As for the boy&mdash;poor little
soul&mdash;no Yankee baby was ever half so helpless; and yet, how brave the
little chap is! What am I to do with 'em? They can't live here when I'm
away to sea; and as for working, why the nigger himself hasn't the least
idee what work means!"</p>

<p>This consultation was held in English, while its objects sat close
together, looking at the sailor as he laid down the case and
expostulated with himself, pro and con, with considerable energy.</p>

<p>"Jube," he said, in broken French, feeling in sad want of counsel,
"Jube, what do you say to living in the country?"</p>

<p>"Oh, anywhere Jube is ready to live&mdash;anywhere that little masser and you
like!" cried the negro, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Well, say in a nice, cosy place up in Connecticut, with plenty of
chores to do, and no hard work."</p>

<p>"Yes, masser Rice," said Jube, attempting English.</p>

<p>"Then, our little Paul, he ought to go to school&mdash;capital district
school on Shrub Oak&mdash;beautiful red school-house, with the turnpike
running in front, and a river back of it. You can hear the water sing
all day long, behind the hemlock bushes. Besides, there's an apple tree
at one end that bears splendid green apples, and a bell pear tree, that
the scholars are forbid to look at. Then&mdash;keep that to yourself Paul, no
one but Kate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span> ever found it out&mdash;but, there's a hollow at one end of the
school-house, and the banks are covered with strawberry vines, white in
the spring, and red all under the grass where the sun has shined on 'em
long enough&mdash;sich strawberries, plump as a baby's mouth, and sweet as
its kisses. What do you think of that, Paul?"</p>

<p>The little fellow did not quite comprehend what Rice was talking about,
but the subject seemed a pleasant one, so he replied, in broken English,
that he should like it very much indeed.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Dave, kindling into enthusiasm by a remembrance of his own
school days, brief as they had been, and spent in a much less pleasant
place than the one he described. "Yes, I kinder see you now, with yer
dinner basket on one arm&mdash;the squaws, back of Chewstown, make
scrumptious little baskets, now I tell yer&mdash;and Webster's blue-covered
spelling book under t'other, a marching off to that ere seat of larning
which I've been telling you about. The picter is so enticing that I'm in
a hurry to begin. Have you ever been to school?"</p>

<p>The boy looked at Jube in doubt what to answer.</p>

<p>"District school, I mean," said Dave, with a flourish of the hand.
"Where the master or mistress boards about, and ferrules the children
with a pine ruler, if they don't toe a crack every spelling time."</p>

<p>"No," said Paul, meekly, "I never did."</p>

<p>"Nor you nuther, Jube?"</p>

<p>Jube opened his great eyes in wonder at the question. It seemed too
astonishing for any other reply.</p>

<p>"Then you hain't neither of you got a bit of larning?" continued Rice,
patronizingly, "can't read nor write, I reckon."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Paul understood this, and brightened up.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Monsieur Rice, I read and write, and do much things in French.
All my life the tutor has taught me how."</p>

<p>"You can, eh! then jist show us what kind of a fist you make of it.
Hallo, here, waiter, bring up pen and ink, with some paper. I want to
see how far this little chap has got along in his eddecation."</p>

<p>The orders were obeyed, and Paul sat down to the rickety table, smiling
as he began to write. Rice stood with his feet wide apart and a hand in
each pocket, looking over the boy's shoulder.</p>

<p>"By jingo, you write like a lady!" he cried, filled with exultation;
"and hain't never been to school! it's 'stonishing. Now let me hear you
spell. We'll skip over the abs, and plunge right into deep larning at
once. Now spell Baker."</p>

<p>Rice plunged his hands deeper into both pockets and shook himself like a
mastiff, satisfied that the boy had got a puzzler now. And so he had,
for it was his first effort at English, and the word, as he tried to
syllable it, was so sweetly broken that Dave shook his head.</p>

<p>"Isn't it right?" inquired Paul, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Well, no, not exactly; but don't be down-hearted. It's a tough word. I
remember studying it over and over again. So keep a stiff upper lip."</p>

<p>"But I shall learn English?" said Paul.</p>

<p>"In course you shall. There's a seat in Shrub Oak school-house waiting
for you now&mdash;the very one sister Kate used to set in, bless her purty
face&mdash;won't she knit woollen comforters for you. The old woman, too. I
say, look a here, shaver, you never saw such a home as you'll find with
my women folks. No skim milk about them, now I tell you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
"Is there good fire," inquired Jube, shivering with the cold, though a
bright blaze flamed on the hearth.</p>

<p>"A good fire? Well I should think so&mdash;back logs as big as porpoises, and
fore sticks to match, trust the old woman for that."</p>

<p>Jube rubbed his hands, and displayed the edge of his firm, white teeth
in a satisfied smile. Warmth was the thing he pined for just then.</p>

<p>"Now that it's settled, supposing we go out and get some good thick
clothes for the shaver, Jube; them silk stockings and finefied shoes
aint the thing, though you do wash and brush them when he's asleep. We
must have socks and boots, and a good thick overcoat, with a seal-skin
cap that turns down at the ears, and yarn mittins. But them, the old
woman will knit, striped two and two, with red and white fringe around
the wrist&mdash;don't I remember the pattern. Come, old chap, it aint far
from here to Catharine street, we'll soon have a full rig."</p>

<p>Of course Jube made no objection; indeed, such was his devotion to Rice,
that it is doubtful if he would have resisted any behest of his. They
went out, looking weather-beaten and shabby enough, shivering with cold,
and sallow from the privation of a hard sea voyage. But after a visit
first to a barber's shop, and next to a clothing store, the whole aspect
of things was changed. Little Paul came forth in a fur cap and an
overcoat, so heavy and thick that even his movements, usually graceful
as an antelope's, became a little awkward. Jube was also warmly clad,
and muffled in a comforter, striped with red, green, and yellow, which
had won his extremest admiration.</p>

<p>After providing for the comfort of his friends in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span> way, Rice took
them to one of the East river wharves, where a sloop, bound for the
mouth of the Housatonic, lay waiting for passengers, and placed them in
charge of the captain. Both Paul and Jube had learned a little broken
English by this time, upon which Rice depended greatly. Besides, he sent
a letter to his mother, beseeching her to receive his friends and
preservers, as he named them, in her own house, and treat them as if
Jube were his brother, and the boy his son&mdash;an adopted son, in every
sense of the word, he certainly was. In a few crude lines he gave his
mother to understand how helpless the child was, and how manfully the
African had stood by him when deserted on the disabled brig, and ended
by promising to come home before the vessel sailed again.</p>

<p>With this letter Rice gave Jube some gold pieces, which made the negro's
eyes sparkle, for he recognized them as the coin circulated in his own
country. Thus having provided for his friends, Rice took his way back to
the disabled ship, and the sloop spread its white wings up the sound.</p>

<p>The deep snow, the skeleton trees, and scattering evergreens that lined
the banks of the Housatonic, struck our poor fugitives from the tropics
with a sense of absolute desolation. But the captain was kind, and this
stood in place of sunshine and warmth with them. At the head of
navigation, which brought the sloop to the mouth of the Naugatuc, the
captain sent them forward with a return team, which, having deposited
its load of produce, was ready to proceed up the river road, which led
from Darby to the long wooden bridge below the falls.</p>

<a name="xxviii" id="xxviii"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">OUT OF HER DELIRIUM.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Alas</span>! it was an unhappy house. Poor Katharine! when the dead child was
brought to her, wrapped in the gorgeous shawl which had been her
brother's gift, she uttered a low wail, so prolonged and mournful that
it never left the memory of those who heard it. As the moan died on her
lips, it seemed to carry her life with it, for she fell into a state of
dumb apathy, and lay for hours together gazing on the wall without a
sign of animation. Then she would mutter, in a low, terrified voice,
"They have found it, they have found it."</p>

<p>The magistrates came to the house and examined the evidences of the
case, but she took no heed of them. The doctor was summoned, but his
opinion, as far as it went, was all against the probabilities of a
natural death. He made every exertion in his power to win the poor
mother to a state of consciousness, but all in vain; she only looked in
his face and muttered, "They have found it, they have found it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen was called forward. She had grown old since the day before.
The hair on her temples was white as frost now, and her figure stooped,
as if some ponderous weight had been laid upon it. Yet the old woman was
calm and still. Had the truth struck her dead at the magistrates' feet,
she would, nevertheless, have spoken it. Her old neighbors knew this,
and refrained from pressing her too far. It would be hard enough, they
whispered in consultation, when she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span> brought into court; why should
they torture her when the evidence was so conclusive.</p>

<p>So the magistrates sat all day with the dead infant lying in its little
coffin on the table before them, deliberating solemnly together; while
that poor mother in the next room, harassed and demented, lay with her
face turned to the wall, muttering beneath her breath, "They have found
it, they have found it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen sat on the hearth in her own high-backed chair, gazing with
heavy eyes on the magistrates. She was chilled and shocked to the soul.
The stiff pride of her nature was broken in twain, leaving her body
bent, and her soul inert. Still, such is the indomitable power of
household routine, in a woman of New England, that she replenished the
fire from time to time, and prepared drink for the poor creature in the
next room. But no food appeared in that dwelling during forty-eight
hours. The cow moaned in its stable from the pain of its abundant milk,
and the pigs, in a pen back of the house, thrust their noses between the
boards and begged for food, with uncouth noises that penetrated into the
house without arousing the mistress. A flock of hens huddled about the
door, pecking at each other and raking up the snow with their claws.</p>

<p>All this made no impression on the woman. When the ashes grew deep in
the fireplace she mechanically shovelled them behind the back log and
sat down again, unconscious of the act; when a stick of wood broke into
brands on each side the andirons, she lifted the massive tongs and
placed them in the midst of the fire again, but with this action her
soul had no part; that seemed dead within her.</p>

<p>At last the magistrates brought in their verdict.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span> <i>The infant had been
murdered by its mother</i>, and she was bound over for trial at the county
court.</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen drew a deep breath when the verdict was announced, and that
was all the sign she gave. The magistrates retired, leaving the house in
charge of the constable. From that hour Katharine Allen was a prisoner
and under arrest. Poor soul, she knew nothing about it. The officers
walked in and out of her room, but she neither spoke nor looked at them.
They stooped over the bed and questioned her persistently, but she took
no heed; a regiment might have tramped through that little room and she
would not have known it.</p>

<p>All that night Mrs. Allen sat by the little coffin in which the babe lay
smiling in its eternal sleep. Nothing but the form of a guard was wanted
for those two helpless women, so the man left in charge fell asleep upon
the hearth, with his head bowed forward and his feet extended. Thus the
night wore on. The grandmother never closed her eyes, and scarcely
moved, but a dead numbness was closing around her heart; she began to
feel the terrible position in which her child was placed&mdash;to feel that
the beautiful babe which had crept into her heart, awaking all its
pristine tenderness, was nothing but cold death.</p>

<p>As these thoughts crowded to her mind, a world of anguish gathered over
that old face, 'till every feature quivered with awakening pain.</p>

<p>As if the anguish of this strong woman had struck some electric spark in
the bosom of her child, a faint moan was heard in the next room. But
that gray head had fallen forward, and the face was buried in her locked
hands. The old woman was trying to pray. But she could not even send up
a moan to the Almighty. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span> that moment she had no faith. The anguish
of a great trouble was upon her which shook her whole being; but the
tenderness that leads to prayer had not yet descended upon her grief.</p>

<p>Under these awakening feelings, she began to be sensible of all the
gloomy surroundings that had helped to oppress her. The tallow candle
upon the table was surmounted by a long wick with a death blossom
trembling at the top, which smothered half its feeble light. Thus the
little coffin was filled with shadows, through which the white face
gleamed mournfully.</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen was all alone. The officer sat sleeping soundly in his
chair&mdash;the young mother lay insensible in the next room. The old woman
was, nevertheless, alone, for such companionship was an added misery.
She could not endure to sit still with that mournful little face
reproaching her from its coffin for its mother's sin; for, as yet, its
death took that shape in her mind. She had no courage to get up and
search for the snuffers, wherewith that ill-omened crest could be
separated from the ungainly wick. An empty cradle stood in one corner of
the room. She took the coffin in her arms, and sat it reverently into
this cradle, spreading the patchwork coverlet over it, thus removing the
pale reality of death from her sight. This done, she sat down by the
table, and let the candle smoke on, indifferent to what it revealed, so
long as the thing was not death.</p>

<p>It is possible that she may have dropped to sleep after this, for nature
was sinking within her; certain it is, her face fell upon the locked
hands, while profound quiet reigned for a little time throughout that
miserable dwelling.</p>

<p>While her face was bowed thus, a frail figure, clad in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span> white drapery
from head to foot, came out of the bedroom and glided up to the table.
She wavered in her walk, and leaned both hands on the table, or she must
have undoubtedly fallen, in feeble helplessness, to the ground.</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen looked up and saw her daughter, worn and trembling, gazing
wistfully upon her.</p>

<p>"Mother, what have you done with it? Who has taken my baby away?"</p>

<p>The voice was sweet, but troubled; the face innocent as an angel's.</p>

<p>"Katharine, oh, Katharine!"</p>

<p>It was all the poor woman could say; but the first gleam of hope shot
athwart that gloomy face and thrilled through the voice. From that
moment the mother felt that her child was innocent.</p>

<p>"Oh, Katharine, my child! my poor, poor child!"</p>

<p>She held out her arms, while great tears rained down her cheeks.</p>

<p>Katharine tottered around the table, and falling on her knees, leaned
heavily on the mother's lap, lifting her face full of wistful tenderness
to the troubled countenance bent over her.</p>

<p>"Tell me what you did with it, mother."</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen trembled under the wistful earnestness of those pleading
eyes. She had no power of speech in her voice. It was choked up with
sorrow for her daughter's inevitable anguish, with thanksgiving that she
was innocent. With a tenderness which is the gift of true Christianity,
link it with the sternest nature you may, she reached forth her arms and
gathered the young thing to her bosom.</p>

<p>"Do tell me, mother, what you have done with my baby?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
"Rest a little, my child. That's right&mdash;keep your arms around me. How
weak you are; and it is cold. Shall I carry you back to bed, my poor
darling?"</p>

<p>"When you have told me. I want the baby, mother; my heart aches for it;
my bosom is full of pain. If we only had it here between us, mother. Do,
do tell me where it is?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen bent her face and kissed her.</p>

<p>"Isn't it pleasant to kiss one's own child, mother? I never thought what
a comfort it was to you before."</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen could not answer; she only bent her withered cheek to the
sweet face on her bosom, and sighed heavily.</p>

<p>"Come, mother."</p>

<p>"One minute, Katharine."</p>

<p>"What is that, mother?"</p>

<p>Katharine had heard the deep breathing of her guard, and turned her
startled face toward him.</p>

<p>"It is a neighbor come to stay with us."</p>

<p>"What! in the night, mother! Why don't he go to bed, then?"</p>

<p>"No one has slept in this house for two nights," answered the mother,
sorrowfully.</p>

<p>Katharine started, and began to tremble.</p>

<p>"Why did you sit up? Was my baby sick?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen folded her child closer, but said nothing.</p>

<p>"You won't tell me, mother."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I cannot."</p>

<p>Katharine broke from her mother's arms, and stood up, white as death.</p>

<p>"Is my baby dead, mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Before it left the woman's lips, Katharine had advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span> to the cradle,
and drawn away the coverlet. She saw what is concealed&mdash;the little
coffin and her child lying coldly within it. Without a word or even a
quick breath, she sank down like an image of snow which the sun has
touched.</p>

<p>Another morning, and the stillness of death fell upon that house. While
the young mother lay bereft of all strength, and scarcely alive, but
with a guard of strong men at her door, the infant was carried out and
reverently buried. No mourners followed it. The old woman watched by the
living mother, not with the leaden despair of former days, but with calm
resignation, which deepened into pathetic tenderness, whenever she
approached the sufferer.</p>

<p>Katharine had whispered a request to see her babe before it was carried
forth. It was brought to her bedside, for those who condemned her as
guilty had some compassion on her youth. It was like a shadow passing
near her, a pale, wan shadow, which would forever float before her
vision, but was devoid of positive reality then. She had no idea of the
way of its death, and suffered like any other bereaved parent, who sees
the first child of love carried away after it has been folded close to
the yearning heart that gave it life.</p>

<p>So the funeral went forth, the saddest of many years, and wound its
solemn way through the snow-trodden streets down to the graveyard, which
gave its white stones to the sunlight on Falls Hill. The shadow of the
church steeple lay softly upon the snow as the funeral passed in, and
when the tiny grave was closed, and all was white and pure as the clouds
of heaven above, the broad Naugatuc sweeping toward its falls below the
hill, seemed chiming a solemn requiem. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span> the crowd dispersed in
groups, whispering with awe over the terrible crime which no one seemed
to doubt, and all regretted. A few thoughtless girls there might have
been, who spoke recklessly of the sin and disgrace which had fallen upon
their lovely schoolmate, but a feeling of compassion predominated, and
even those who came to that little grave condemning the mother, went
away subdued and doubting. Gossip there certainly was&mdash;what country
village ever existed without that?&mdash;but Katharine's fault was far too
serious for light comment. Even strong men held their breadth when the
penalty of death was mentioned in connection with that helpless girl.</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="xxix" id="xxix"></a>CHAPTER XXIX.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">STRANGERS IN THE VILLAGE.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> forgotten one circumstance which happened that morning. Just as
the funeral was turning from the highway toward the graveyard, a colored
man and a young boy, both of foreign
<a name="appearance" id="appearance"></a><ins title="Original has appearence">appearance</ins>, came up
the hill from the bridge, where one of the river sleighs had set them
down. After standing for a moment watching the procession with
curiosity, they walked reverently after it, looking very sad, as if
trouble were familiar to them. The negro led the boy by the hand, and
both stood apart from the crowd while the funeral service was read. It
was remarked that the negro seemed greatly disturbed as he looked upon
the grave, and that his eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span> filled with tears when he turned them on
the serious face of the boy. Poor fellow! he was thinking of another
funeral, where orange blossoms perfumed the air, and hosts of wild
flowers brightened the turf which was laid above the dead.</p>

<p>When the ceremony was over, and the people began to disperse, Jube
approached a little group of men who lingered by the gate, and inquired,
in very imperfect English, if some one would show him the way to a place
called Bungy, and if a widow lady by the name of Allen did not live
there.</p>

<p>This was a new source of excitement. The foreign look and broken
language peculiar to the strangers, were something to be wondered at and
talked over, even at this solemn hour. The men drew away from the
neighborhood of the burying-ground before they indulged in the curiosity
which was consuming them, and for once answered a question directly,
without asking another in the same breath, an instance of forbearance
deserving of honorable record in these pages. But the moment they
reached the road the awe of the place left them, and the direct
examination of poor Jube commenced.</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen&mdash;of course everybody knew the widow Allen, and no wonder,
after that funeral; but what did the stranger want of her&mdash;wanted to
hire out, perhaps. Jube did not know what hiring out meant, and answered
vaguely that perhaps he did, but wasn't quite certain.</p>

<p>This rather excited curiosity. What if this black fellow should prove to
know something about the murder, or, at any rate, of the person who had
led poor Katharine Allen into all this trouble. This idea whetted the
questions that were let loose on the travellers, till both the negro and
boy were thoroughly bewildered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
"Mebbe you're acquainted with Mrs. Allen&mdash;knew her afore she moved here,
I dare say!" suggested a farmer from over the hill.</p>

<p>Jube shook his head, more to express his incapacity to understand than
as a negative to the question.</p>

<p>"No; that's sort o' strange; but then, perhaps, you're related to some
of the colored people hereabouts?"</p>

<p>"No, agin; stranger and stranger yet&mdash;not know Mrs. Allen, nor any of
the colored population of this neighborhood. Then jist excuse me if I
ask who on arth you are acquainted with?"</p>

<p>"We know Mr. Rice, the widow lady's son," answered Paul, in his sweet,
broken language, and lifting a face to the stranger that softened every
feature of his rough visage.</p>

<p>"You know David Rice, my little shaver! Wall, we reckon not, for he was
drowned three months or more ago. Wrecked at sea. Captain Thrasher
e'nmost saw him go down."</p>

<p>"It was on that ship we with him! Jube he help him bring her into port!"
cried the boy, his great, velvety eyes filling with light as he lifted
them exultingly to the negro.</p>

<p>The story of two persons&mdash;a negro and a boy&mdash;having insisted on sharing
the fate of David Rice, on the disabled vessel, had gone the rounds of
the village, and a general burst of surprise followed the boy's speech.</p>

<p>"Now, you don't say so! You the little shaver that sot right down by
Dave Rice on that deck, and wouldn't get up on no consideration!" cried
one. "Wall, now, how things du turn out. I couldn't a believed it, and
sich a slender little critter, too; I swan to man, it beats all!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Paul understood that the man was praising him for something, and in his
modest innocence strove to set him right.</p>

<p>"No, no, no; not me; I am very little boy, very weak, and so small. I
only eat great deal, and drink water, when Jube wanted it very much to
keep him strong. It was Jube, my Jube, that helped save the ship. I wish
you could see how him swing the pump handle&mdash;all the time, daylight and
dark, no matter, Jube work, work, work, I no!"</p>

<p>The farmer who had been the most ardent spokesman, stepped forth now,
reaching out his hands.</p>

<p>"I say, cuffy, give us yer hand. If you're the feller that stood by Rice
when he hadn't a chance left, I'm proud to know ye. If you raly did
bring him safe ashore&mdash;well, by golly, if I aint e'enamost a crying!
Now, you don't say that Dave Rice is alive?"</p>

<p>"Left him much well in New York two days ago; me and Jube," answered the
boy, smiling at the farmer's enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Yes, little masser."</p>

<p>"Master! Now, you don't mean tu say that this little black-eyed shaver
is your master, in earnest, cuffy?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jube, showing every white tooth in his head. "Reckon little
masser won't say no!"</p>

<p>"And you're his slave&mdash;a rale, downright sarvant, ha?"</p>

<p>"Yes; that's it!" answered Jube, with another happy laugh. "Little
masser hasn't none but me now."</p>

<p>"You don't say so!"</p>

<p>"But we both owned to Captain Rice, now. Jube, you not forgot that,"
said Paul, earnestly.</p>

<p>"What's that you're a saying! Dave Rice a bringing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span> home slaves into old
Connecticut, and one uv 'em e'enamost white! I say, neighbors, what will
the selectmen say to that?"</p>

<p>Instantly there was a season of whispered and eager consultation. With
all their joy over the deliverance of Rice from a watery grave, the
neighbors were not prepared to accept the slaves he seemed to be sending
home from foreign parts.</p>

<p>"What do you think," said the chief speaker, "they'll perhaps become an
expense to the town, and have to be bid off for their board with the
other paupers&mdash;supposing we send them back."</p>

<p>"Wait till we've examined 'em according to law," interposed another, who
was a selectman of the township. "Perhaps I'd better do it. Now jest
stand by and listen."</p>

<p>"What do you do for a living, if I may ask," he commenced, planting
himself in the road in front of Jube, "before we admit strangers,
especially colored, it's as well to be sure that they wont be a town
charge&mdash;what do you foller?"</p>

<p>Jube shook his head&mdash;the whole speech was a mystery to him.</p>

<p>"What do you foller?" persisted the selectman, getting impatient.</p>

<p>"What do I folly!" repeated Jube, with a puzzled look, then brightening
up all at once, he added with a smile:</p>

<p>"Me folly little masser."</p>

<p>"But how do you get your living?"</p>

<p>"He's my father now, and me support him," said Paul, with dignity, for
he began to comprehend a little of the conversation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
"And who supports you, my little shaver?"</p>

<p>"Me have money," answered Paul; "Jube, show monsieur much money there in
the purse."</p>

<p>Jube took a heavy shot bag from his pocket, and opening it exhibited
more gold than the selectman had ever seen in his life. The whole group
of countrymen gathered around him, full of eager curiosity.</p>

<p>"I should think that satisfactory," said one of the speakers, addressing
the selectman.</p>

<p>"No doubt on that point," was the answer; "but where on arth du they
come from, I should raly like to know."</p>

<p>"Will you please tell us some way," said Paul, modestly. "It is much
cold here, and Jube likes a fire too much."</p>

<p>"You want to know the road to Mrs. Allen's?"</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur, that is the name!"</p>

<p>"Well, she lives over the hill."</p>

<p>"Which way we go, monsieur?"</p>

<p>"No, it isn't monsur, but Bungy that you're after."</p>

<p>"And that way, if you please?"</p>

<p>"Turn round that great willer tree on the corner, keep to the left of
the white house back of it, and then go straight along. It's a brown
house with a narrow door yard, and a shag bark walnut tree standing at
one end&mdash;you can't miss it, no how."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the boy, lifting his cap with the grace of a little
prince, "monsieur are much kind."</p>

<p>Jube also lifted his cap, and stood close by his master, a good deal
puzzled and disturbed by the conversation that had been forced upon
them.</p>

<p>The men who were left behind drew together in a group.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
"It's a bad time for strangers to be asking the way to that house," said
the selectman, looking after the travellers, "but one couldn't make them
understand. With officers in charge, and that miserable girl lying at
the point of death, as I may say, it will come hard on Mrs. Allen. I
almost wish some of us had taken them home."</p>

<p>"Let them go," said the man addressed. "They bring good news from the
son that was lost&mdash;poor woman, she will find that God does not
altogether forsake her, though it is an awful trial she is going
through."</p>

<p>With a parting salutation, so respectful from Jube, and so elegant from
the boy, that the men stood quite confounded, the old negro and his
charge passed on up the hill.</p>

<p>"It's the first brown house," one of the little group called out, as
soon as he recovered his power of speech, which, like those of any true
New Englander, were not to be checked long by any condition whatever;
"the first brown house, and ask for widder Allen."</p>

<p>The two strangers looked back, comprehending the gesture which
accompanied these words, and, with another courteous salute, disappeared
along a bend in the road.</p>

<p>"We've almost reached our journey's end, Jube," the boy said, in their
native tongue, after they had walked some distance.</p>

<p>"Yes, little master," said Jube, in the same tongue, "that's the house I
see now up yonder."</p>

<p>"I wonder if she is a kind woman?" the boy continued, his thoughts
reverting to all the trouble and cruelty of the past months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
"I hope so, little master; it's a woman's nature, most times; and if she
have a spark of goodness in her heart, it must come out when she see
that blessed young face."</p>

<p>"Dave's mother ought to be kind and good, I am sure."</p>

<p>"Very nice man, that Master Rice; Jube will never forget him, never!"</p>

<p>With such broken conversation, they pursued their way, and soon reached
the summit of the hill. Just before them was the old farm house which
once looked so cheerful and pleasant, but now a quiet so profound
pervaded the whole place that it seemed like a shadow deepening under
the trouble which oppressed its inmates.</p>

<p>With his refined instincts and sympathies, the boy felt a peculiar
restlessness creep over his mind as he approached the dwelling.</p>

<p>"How still it is, Jube," he said, unconsciously sinking his voice to a
whisper, as they lingered for an instant by the gate; "it seems as if
they were all sick or dead."</p>

<p>"Not that, little master," replied Jube, occupied with the reflection
that his beloved charge had at last reached a place of tranquillity, and
incapable of the vague emotions which agitated the sensitive nerves of
the child.</p>

<p>He opened the gate, and held it ajar for the boy to pass through. Never
once, in all their sorrow and confusion, had he forgotten the respect
which was due to his old master's son.</p>

<p>"Go in, Master Paul; don't be afeard, Jube is with you yet."</p>

<p>"I am not afraid; I only feel sorry for these strange people; but why, I
cannot tell."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Jube made no answer to the fancies which he could not comprehend; and,
after that momentary hesitation, the boy passed up the little garden
path to the house, and waited, while the negro gave a quick, eager rap
upon the door.</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen was occupied in the bedroom, and did not hear the summons,
but it aroused the officer who sat over the kitchen fire, struggling
with sleep and the dreary reflections to which the place and his duty
gave rise.</p>

<p>"Come in!" he called, in a low voice; then, fearful of disturbing the
sick girl, whom he had already begun to pity, in spite of the sin and
guilt which he believed to be upon her, he rose from his chair, and
walked to the door, starting in astonishment when he opened it, and saw
the two strangers standing there.</p>

<p>Paul looked at Jube for assistance, and Jube looked back at him so
helpless and confused, in his efforts to recall his very imperfect
English, that the boy was obliged to depend upon his own courage and
knowledge of the harsh tongue.</p>

<p>"Madame Allen live here?" he asked, while the officer, between
astonishment at his grace and foreign accent, only stared the harder,
instead of answering.</p>

<p>"Moder to Masser Rice," added Jube, coming to his young master's
assistance, and after successfully pronouncing so much in his best
English, he rushed into a flood of French, which completed the man's
bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Land's sake!" he exclaimed. "What on arth does the critter mean&mdash;never
heerd such a lingo in all my life!"</p>

<p>"<i>Chut!</i>" whispered Paul to his companion; "he doesn't understand you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
The recollection quite took Jube by surprise. He ceased at once, his
mouth gaping wide, and the whites of his eyes displayed in bewildering
astonishment.</p>

<p>"We wish Madame Allen," pursued the boy.</p>

<p>"De moder of her son," put in Jube, coming to his senses, and
determining to assist his master by every means in his power.</p>

<p>"The widder Allen lives here," replied the man, "if you want her&mdash;the
Lord knows she near enough crazy, anyhow," he continued, in a lower
tone. "But walk in, walk in."</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="xxx" id="xxx"></a>CHAPTER XXX.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">THE WELCOME LETTER.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> guard left Paul and his black friend standing on the door step, and
went toward the bedroom, calling, in a half-whisper,</p>

<p>"Here, Mrs. Allen, somebody wants you."</p>

<p>The old woman heard his voice, and came out into the kitchen, closing
the bedroom door, and looking with as much astonishment at the strangers
as her numbed faculties would permit her to feel.</p>

<p>"They want to see you," said the officer, turning toward her; "I can't
make out nothing more&mdash;they talk such outlandish lingo."</p>

<p>Paul motioned Jube to follow, and entered the kitchen. He walked up to
the old lady and removed his cap with a low bow, saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
"It is Madame Allen&mdash;the mother of Monsieur Rice?"</p>

<p>"I was his mother," she replied, in a hollow voice, "but he is dead.
What do you want of me, little boy?"</p>

<p>"This letter for you," Paul continued, taking the carefully preserved
epistle from his pocket.</p>

<p>The old woman shrunk away, and put out her hand as if to thrust the
letter aside.</p>

<p>"More trouble," she muttered. "What can come now?"</p>

<p>Paul understood, rather from the expression of her face than a
comprehension of her words, that she was startled.</p>

<p>"Very good news," he said. "The lady much happy now."</p>

<p>"Happy!" she repeated. "Who is that from?"</p>

<p>"From him&mdash;from madame's own son!"</p>

<p>She only looked incredulous; she was so stunned by suffering that her
mind could not readily receive any new impression.</p>

<p>"I haven't any son," she said; "my son is dead."</p>

<p>The boy glanced anxiously toward Jube, and the old negro felt bound to
offer his assistance, although sadly at a loss to remember a single
English word by which matters might be explained.</p>

<p>"No dead, lady!" he exclaimed; "bery live, Masser Rice; yes,
certainement; very much so."</p>

<p>The old woman gave him a wild look, snatched the letter from Paul's
hand, and tore it open, while the three stood gazing at her in
astonishment.</p>

<p>"His writing," she muttered. "Oh, I must be going crazy!"</p>

<p>She read the page, retreated backward, and fell into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span> chair, while the
letter fluttered slowly to the floor. She understood the contents, but
had wept so much during the past days, that no tears were left; even joy
could not revivify the wasted fount.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Mrs. Allen?" exclaimed the officer, frightened by
her appearance. "Don't look so; don't now; it skeers a fellow!"</p>

<p>She pointed to the letter.</p>

<p>"Read it to me," she whispered; "read it, I say; maybe I shall believe
it then."</p>

<p>The man picked up the sheet, and spelled out the tidings as well as his
astonishment and Rice's crabbed writing would permit.</p>

<p>"My son is alive," muttered the woman. "God has not altogether forsaken
me!"</p>

<p>"Alive!" repeated the officer; "gone another voyage, and sent these two
here."</p>

<p>Paul had crept close to Jube, and slipped his slender fingers into the
broad palm of his trusty companion, startled by the scene.</p>

<p>"You came from my son?" said the woman, looking earnestly at them.</p>

<p>"Yes," interrupted the officer; "seems to be a sort of adoptation on
Dave's part; he's dreadful perticular to have the boy sent to the
district school to once."</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen struggled with herself, managed to rise, and walked toward
the chamber door.</p>

<p>"Stay here," she said; "sit down and wait for me."</p>

<p>They understood her words, and seated themselves as she directed. Her
heavy tread upon the stairs echoed down into the room, and when it died
away in the garret, they sat waiting, while the officer stared at them
as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span> if they had been two strange birds, placed there for his
observation.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Allen reached the cold, silent garret, she sank upon her knees
on the bare boards and tried to pray. Broken and faint were the murmurs
which fell from her lips; but gradually, through that silent prayer, a
ray of holy happiness stole over her haggard features&mdash;God had sent one
gleam of light into the terrible blackness which surrounded her.</p>

<p>She rose, at length, strengthened, and able more clearly to reflect upon
the joy that had come so unexpectedly into the midst of her anguish.</p>

<p>Her son was alive&mdash;it was better that he should not be there&mdash;he could
in no way aid Katharine. As for her own portion of the agony, only God
could help her to endure that. But he was alive, and would come back in
time to comfort her.</p>

<p>Nearly half an hour must have elapsed before she descended the stairs
and again entered the kitchen. The strangers were still seated by the
fire, and the officer had sufficiently recovered from his stupor of
astonishment to overpower them with all sorts of questions, very few of
which they understood; but as they made up for this lack of
comprehension by a courtesy altogether new and puzzling to him, he had
to make the best of matters.</p>

<p>"They come from 'way off, goodness knows where," he said, turning toward
Mrs. Allen. "Dave's the queerest fellow to pick up odd critters!"</p>

<p>The woman paid no attention to his words, but went up to Paul and laid
her hand on his shoulder; the look of childish comprehension and
sympathy which he lifted to her face seemed to go to her heart as no
expressions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span> of kindness from another had been able to do. A faint dew
gathered in her eyes, but no absolute tears.</p>

<p>"Are you hungry?" she asked. "I will get you something to eat."</p>

<p>"Madame must not trouble much," Paul said, respectfully.</p>

<p>"It's the natur' o' children and darkies to eat," remarked the officer,
sapiently; "you'd better hunt 'em up a cold bite. I feel kinder hungry
myself, Mrs. Allen."</p>

<p>The old woman went about her duties in a methodical way, finding a kind
of relief in the occupation. She placed such food as she had prepared
upon the table, and motioned Paul to sit down. Before the little fellow
touched a morsel himself, he heaped a plate with great slices of
gingerbread and mince pie, and carried them to Jube.</p>

<p>"Do look at that," muttered the officer; "wal, I never seed a little
chap have so much manners afore."</p>

<p>"You are much kind," Paul said to Mrs. Allen; "so was good Rice&mdash;<i>le
grand Dieu</i> will bless both."</p>

<p>"Granite do," remarked the officer; "I wonder if that's his name?"</p>

<p>"The letter says, Paul," returned the woman.</p>

<p>"Me; that me," said the boy, catching his name, and looking up with a
smile.</p>

<p>The woman once more took up the letter, and sat down to gain a clearer
knowledge of its contents.</p>

<p>"And you're sent here to stay," she said, with a weary sigh, as she
folded the sheet. "Dear me, what a place for anyone to come to!"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the boy, understanding her first words; "in few
months&mdash;tree, four, Monsieur Rice come too."</p>

<p>"His name is Dave," said the officer; "but, la! I calculate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span> they have
all sorts of queer names for folks in them out of the way countries."</p>

<p>When Paul had finished his meal he returned to his old place on the
little stool by Jube's side, and the pair sat looking wistfully at each
other, oppressed by the strangeness and gloom of the place.</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen paid little attention to them. She washed the dishes with her
usual care, and put them away in the corner cupboard, brushed the
hearth, moved restlessly about, finding that relief in constant
occupation which the mind is sure to seek during a great sorrow.</p>

<p>Paul sat watching her with his large, wistful eyes, for she had
strangely excited some inexplicable sympathy in his heart.</p>

<p>After a time a feeble voice called from the bedroom.</p>

<p>"Mother; where are you, mother?"</p>

<p>Katharine had awakened, and was startled to find herself alone; but at
the summons the old woman went into the bedroom, and the murmur of their
voices reached the kitchen faintly.</p>

<p>In a few moments Mrs. Allen came out with a cup in her hand. She went to
the fire, took a tin basin from the hearth, and poured a portion of the
contents into the cup, but her hands shook so tremulously that the hot
liquid spilled over them.</p>

<p>Paul arose, and took the dish from her with his usual gentleness.</p>

<p>"Let me carry it," he said. "Madame very tired."</p>

<p>Poor old madame! His kindness touched her like a new pang. She followed
him to the bedroom and took the cup again.</p>

<p>"Sick lady there?" he whispered.</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen bent her head, she could not speak just then.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
"Paul will help," continued the boy. "Paul nursed mamma once&mdash;please let
him help the sweet mademoiselle."</p>

<p>The boy had caught a glimpse of Katharine's face, and his own
brightened.</p>

<p>The old woman felt as if an angel had unexpectedly been sent to aid her
in her misery&mdash;the pitying light in those beautiful eyes went to her
heart like a blessing.</p>

<p>After that, every time she went in or out, Paul watched her movements
and assisted her in his unobtrusive way, then crept back to Jube, and
waited to see in what manner he could next express his desire to be of
use.</p>

<p>"He goes about as handy as a pet kitten," said the officer at last,
sorely perplexed in his mind. "Got a mother, little chap?"</p>

<p>The negro understood these words, and put up his hands with a warning
gesture.</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Mrs. Allen, sternly; "you know what the letter said."</p>

<p>"I forgot," returned the man, and he began uneasily biting his finger
nails, to hide his confusion; but the nails proved very horny and tough,
and he failed to get rid of much contrition in that way.</p>

<p>Paul made no answer to his question; he only retreated a little closer
to Jube, and laid his head upon the negro's knee. The simple action
wrung Mrs. Allen's heart with a new pang. Hard and severe as her nature
was, it had become so softened under her grief that she was unusually
observant, and touched by trifles which at another time would have
passed by unheeded.</p>

<p>"I expect you're tired," said the officer, pointing his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span> finger, with
its dilapidated nail, at the boy; "you're tired now, aint you?"</p>

<p>"A little," said Paul, without raising his head. "Only very little."</p>

<p>Jube knew by the sorrowful voice that the child was thinking of his
mother, and had been pained by the man's thoughtless question in regard
to her. He attempted no consolation in words, but laid his great hand
protectingly upon the boy's shoulder. The two crept a little closer to
each other, feeling a sort of safety and comfort in that silent
companionship.</p>

<p>"I expect they feel kinder cold," remarked the officer.</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen heard, and remembered that there was a fireplace in the
chamber where she intended them to sleep. She went out into the wood
house for pine knots to kindle a fire, but Paul had followed her with
that solicitude to which she was so unaccustomed, and when he saw her
errand, motioned Jube to follow.</p>

<p>"Jube very strong," he said; "carry me&mdash;carry wood&mdash;likes to do it too
much."</p>

<p>The old woman attempted no opposition; she allowed the negro to take up
an armful of sticks, and led the way up-stairs in silence, Paul still
accompanying them, from an unwillingness to remain alone with the
strange man.</p>

<p>Jube's intentions were of the most praiseworthy description, but it must
be confessed that his success in making a fire was not equal to his
ambition. When Mrs. Allen saw that he only succeeded in raising a smoke
instead of kindling a flame, she took the matter into her own hands, and
speedily the knots and kindlings were hissing and snapping on the unused
hearth at a famous rate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
"Jube learn," Paul said, smiling at both, and trying to comfort the
negro's evident discomfiture, "learn very quick. <i>Tout suit!</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes, little masser," he replied; "Jube know how next time."</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen signified to them that they were to sleep in that room; there
was a trundle bed for Paul, which Katharine had occupied when a child,
and she improvised a very comfortable sort of couch for the attendant.
She spread a bit of rag carpet before Paul's bed, and made every thing
homelike and tidy for the shivering strangers.</p>

<p>"Come down and warm," she said, when her preparations were completed,
noticing that they shivered with cold.</p>

<p>Paul and Jube followed her down-stairs and took their former seats by
the fire, while she, after stealing into the bedroom, to be certain that
Katharine slept, took her station by the hearth likewise, and remained
gazing drearily into the fire.</p>

<p>At last she seemed to remember how late it was, and, getting up, took a
brass warming-pan, with its long wooden handle, which she filled with
hot coals. Thus armed, she went up-stairs, came down again after an
absence of ten minutes, and told her guests to go up to bed before the
sheets got cold.</p>

<p>When the two went up-stairs, Jube found his humble bed warmed
comfortably, like that of his little master.</p>

<br />
<span class="sub">THE RED SCHOOL-HOUSE AT SHRUB OAK.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> entire week that poor girl lay upon the verge of death; but so
still, so mournfully feeble, that it would have pained you to look at
her. The sound of her voice must have sent you from her presence
heart-broken. The doctor visited her every day. At times he attempted to
arouse her with some of his droll sayings, but the voice in which they
were uttered was so pitiful that she understood it only as a
compassionate attempt to comfort her, and so, in truth, it was.</p>

<p>One day, when the fever had left her brain, and she could scarcely speak
for want of strength, Katharine whispered the doctor to sit down a
little while, as she had something to ask him about.</p>

<p>The doctor slid his crutches along the floor, and seated himself on the
edge of the bed, looking very grave, for he felt what the poor thing was
about to say.</p>

<p>"Doctor."</p>

<p>"Well, my child."</p>

<p>"What is that man always staying in the kitchen for?"</p>

<p>"That man&mdash;oh! he's help."</p>

<p>"Night and day, night and day, he's always there," murmured the unhappy
girl. "He tries to keep out of sight; but every time the door opens I
see his shadow on the wall."</p>

<p>"And it frightens you, poor child; is that it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, doctor, it troubles me. I want to know what it means?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
"He has been sent here to keep your mother company."</p>

<p>She looked at him with reproachful earnestness, tried to shake her head,
but the languid eyelids only drooped over the blue orbs fastened on his
face, and, directly, tears began to swell under them.</p>

<p>"I heard people talking in the other room, doctor; what was it about?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you, not knowing what they said."</p>

<p>"They were talking about my baby."</p>

<p>The word broke out in a sob, and tears gushed through her trembling
eyelashes. The doctor laid his hand on her head, and then the convulsion
of her grief became heart-rending.</p>

<p>"Hush, child, hush! don't cry, don't cry&mdash;it will hurt you."</p>

<p>"Doctor, what&mdash;what did my baby die of?"</p>

<p>The doctor turned white with the pain and surprise of that question.</p>

<p>"Won't you tell me, doctor?"</p>

<p>He looked at her in stern distrust. Her face was innocent as a child's.
She interrogated his countenance imploringly through her tears.</p>

<p>"Don't you know, Katharine?"</p>

<p>She began to cry bitterly.</p>

<p>"How could I? no one tells me, and I can't remember any thing."</p>

<p>"Katharine, is this true?"</p>

<p>"Is what true, doctor?"</p>

<p>"Have you no knowledge how the child died?"</p>

<p>"No; I was in bed here, shaking with cold and burning up with fever. I
wanted the baby, and got up; it was in the cradle, dead. Oh, I remember
so well how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span> white its little face was&mdash;how white and cold. I came back
again, crept into bed, and wished that God would let me die, too."</p>

<p>"And this is all you know?"</p>

<p>"Yes, doctor; I was afraid to ask mother about it&mdash;she looks so strange;
but you will tell me every thing."</p>

<p>The doctor gathered up his crutches hurriedly, and stamped his way into
the next room.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Allen," he said, sharply, "you are a brave woman. I'm nothing but
a poor, miserable coward. I'm going to sneak off, and let you talk to
that poor girl. I could cut the throat of a lamb when it was looking
into my eyes as soon as tell her what must come. You're a Christian,
Mrs. Allen, a downright Christian, and no sham&mdash;crusty and bitter, sharp
and honest. You can do it; I can't. You're a Bible woman; I'm an old
sinner, and am running away&mdash;do you understand&mdash;because I'm an
abominable old coward. Tell her yourself."</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen turned white as parchment. She understood the doctor's
meaning in full.</p>

<p>"Has she been asking questions, doctor?"</p>

<p>"Yes; enough to break a commonly good heart&mdash;but mine is tough as sole
leather."</p>

<p>"She is better?"</p>

<p>"Yes; a great deal better."</p>

<p>"And when she is well enough to be moved, they will take her away?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so&mdash;the hounds."</p>

<p>The woman stood motionless&mdash;her hands tightly clasped, and her lips
stiffening with pain.</p>

<p>"You are right," she said; "who but her mother should take up this
burden. I will tell Katharine."</p>

<p>"Not 'till I am out of sight!" cried the doctor, wheeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span> sharply on
his crutches. "I tell you, woman, I can't stand it&mdash;feel like a butcher
for what I have done. The law is an abomination. Why can't they let my
pretty pigeon alone? As if there wasn't babies enough without making a
fuss if one does drop off a little out of the common way?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell her. It's hard, but what is before me I can do," said the
woman.</p>

<p>"Can't I help little?" said a sweet voice from the hearth, "or Jube?
he's very strong."</p>

<p>The doctor looked down on little Paul with a glance half quizzical, half
serious.</p>

<p>"You, little shoat, you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if madame please," said Paul, with a sad smile; "if there's
trouble, I and Jube very used to it. We've been in a boat together three
days, with nothing but red hot sun and many waters to look on, till they
blind us. We know how to be hungry and cold, and he knows how to be
whipped on his back and never say a word. That is why we can help."</p>

<p>"That little trooper is what I call a pilgrim," muttered the guard,
nodding at the doctor with a wink of the left eye.</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen laid her unsteady hand on Paul's dark curls. "He is a good
boy, and God will bless him," she said.</p>

<p>Paul, with that touching grace that is so beautiful in highly bred
children of foreign birth, took the hard hand of his benefactress and
touched it to his lips.</p>

<p>"He ought to have been sent to school," she said, in a weary voice,
addressing the doctor. "My son charged it upon me, but I could not leave
her."</p>

<p>The doctor wheeled round, and examined Paul's face from beneath his
heavy eyebrows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
"Go get your cap and great coat," he said with gruff kindness. "If
you've got a wedge of mince pie or a slice of gingerbread, Mrs. Allen,
drop it into a dinner basket, and I'll put the shaver on his course of
studies in double-quick time. Send him out when all is ready."</p>

<p>It took the doctor some minutes to mount his horse. By the time he was
in the saddle, Paul came forth with a painted dinner basket on his arm.
A new pair of mittens imprisoned his delicate hands, while the yarn
comforter that Rice had given him was twisted around his neck, and
concealed the lower part of his face.</p>

<p>"That's right, little trooper; climb up the fence and hop on behind.
That's it&mdash;sharp as a steel trap. Sit up close and hold on to my belt.
All right. Here we go! Get up! Get along, I say!"</p>

<p>The doctor's horse had been used to carrying double in all sorts of
ways, so he only threw up his head, and cast his long mane on the air
like a banner, intending this action as a protest against extra burdens
in general, before he started off in a heavy trot toward Falls Hill.</p>

<p>The doctor was heavy-hearted enough, but he took some note of the
strange child under his charge, told him to hang on to his belt like a
dog to a sassafras root, and expressed a decided opinion that Paul would
be a man before his mother, which filled the boy's heart with sadness,
as that word mother was ever sure to do.</p>

<p>The red school-house at Shrub Oak was half a mile out of the doctor's
way, but instead of setting Paul down at the willow tree on the corner,
he put his eccentric steed to its mettle, and drew up in front of that
sublime seat of learning with considerable dash.</p>

<p>"Holloa there, Tibbles! Holloa! I say! Come out and get a new scholar."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
Mr. Tibbles, the master, heard this shout while in the midst of his
pupils, and laying down his ruler with dignity, moved toward the door,
leaving a hum and rush of whispers behind, which might have reminded one
of Babel before the inmates had ventured entirely upon their new
tongues.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Tibbles? Young ideas shoot prosperously&mdash;ha? Give 'em
the birch&mdash;give 'em the birch. Nothing like it. Whipped half out of my
skin before I got through Webster's spelling-book. Did me good. Give 'em
birch; and if you can't find that handy, try hemlock sprouts. Tingle
beautifully."</p>

<p>The master took these suggestions demurely, and asked if the little boy
upon the horse wanted to come to school.</p>

<p>"Yes. Hop down, shaver. Give him a lift, Tibbles. A little Frenchman
from St. Domingo. Nothing but a nest of niggers left there. Killed all
the white folks off. Nice country, that. You have heard of the boy that
stuck to the wrecked brig with Dave Rice?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, doctor," answered Tibbles, brightening.</p>

<p>"There he is, large as life. Take good care of him, for he's worth a
dozen of your common fellows. Put him through English, and give him a
touch of Latin, if you remember any. Who knows but I may take him for a
student one of these days?"</p>

<p>While the doctor was speaking, he took Paul by the hand, and swung him
lightly to the ground. Mr. Tibbles took possession of the handsome boy
with no little pride; for the child who had stood so manfully by David
Rice had become a historical character in Shrub Oak, and the master felt
the dignity of his school enhanced by Paul's advent there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
Paul was a good deal embarrassed as he entered school with thirty pairs
of eyes levelled at him, sparkling with every possible degree of
curiosity. He sat down on a little bench, blushing like a girl, but
looking so modest and gentle withal, that the whole school felt a
general and kindly impulse toward the stranger. The bluest covered
spelling-book was handed to him from the master's desk. One boy
volunteered to lend him a slate, and another took a new pencil from his
pocket and gave it to him outright, looking triumphantly round at the
little girls' bench to be sure that his intimacy with the distinguished
stranger had made its impression in that quarter.</p>

<p>At noon time there was no limit to the hospitalities of the occasion;
wonder-cakes, biscuits, and wedges of pumpkin pie, made their way into
Paul's dinner basket. One pretty little girl slily offered him a rusty
coated apple, and another was ambitious to teach him how to slide on a
strip of ice that lay, like a mammoth looking-glass, a little distance
down the turnpike.</p>

<p>Paul received all these kindnesses with gentle grace. His broken speech,
the sweet expression of his eyes, the natural refinement which even
children could feel, made him a general favorite in less than two hours.
The large boys were already arranging to lend him their sleds. As for
the girls, the whispering and nudging that took place among them
whenever the lad lifted those splendid eyes from his book, was a scandal
to the whole school and sex.</p>

<p>When Paul went out of school at night he felt very lonesome and forlorn,
not exactly knowing his way home, and a good deal dismayed by the snow,
which was getting damp and heavy, with a succession of warm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span> foggy
days. While he was standing in the door, uncertain which way to turn,
two large boys, rosy from the fresh air, came racing up harnessed to a
hand sled, in their opinion a marvel of workmanship, which was expected
to lift the stranger off his feet with admiration.</p>

<p>With cordial hospitality, the boys offered this conveyance to Paul, who
accepted it in good faith, and the boys carried him away in triumph,
dashing off toward Falls Hill, and up the crossroad, in splendid style.</p>

<p>The next day, one of these boys&mdash;the same little fellow who had given
Rose Mason the string of robins' eggs, might have been seen hanging
around Mrs. Allen's gate, looking wistfully at the front door. When it
opened, and Paul came forth, the lad ran to meet him, and the two went
away together, talking earnestly on the road to school.</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="xxxii" id="xxxii"></a>CHAPTER XXXII.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">A TERRIBLE DISCLOSURE.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Alas</span>! the sad and heavy-hearted sorrow that was left behind on the day
that little Paul went forth to his school-boy life. Twice, Mrs. Allen
went into Katharine's room and sat down, pale and soul-stricken, waiting
to be questioned; but her daughter had been exhausted by her
conversation with the doctor, and lay with her eyes closed, weary of all
things. So, drawing a deep breath from a consciousness of this reprieve,
the wretched woman went away again still more heavily laden with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
duty that clung to her like a vampire, and so a week passed by without
another attempt. At last, toward nightfall one day, Katharine spoke:</p>

<p>"Mother?"</p>

<p>"My child."</p>

<p>"What is it that you are all afraid of telling me?"</p>

<p>"A great trouble, Katharine; something that even I, who have some
courage, tremble to speak of."</p>

<p>"Is it about my baby, mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I am glad you are willing to answer me; the doctor put me off."</p>

<p>"But I will not put you off, my poor child."</p>

<p>"What is it, mother? This frightens me&mdash;your voice is husky, your face
strange&mdash;did my baby die a hard death?"</p>

<p>"Yes, very hard. It was killed."</p>

<p>The voice was indeed husky that uttered these words.</p>

<p>Katharine rose up in the bed, her eyes grew large and wild.</p>

<p>"Killed?"</p>

<p>"Yes, God help us&mdash;it was dead and buried when we found it."</p>

<p>"Dead and buried; mother, mother!"</p>

<p>The words came forth in a sharp cry, breaking the pale lips apart and
leaving them so.</p>

<p>"I left it alive, Katharine&mdash;sleeping by your side. Can you remember
when I went out that day after a man to haul some wood from Castle
Rock?"</p>

<p>Katharine held both hands to her temples, rocking to and fro as if the
effort to think cost great pain.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, I remember about the wood. You put the shawl, that David
sent me, over my shoulders. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span> baby was asleep then, with one hand to
its mouth. I took the hand away just to see it nestle; its pretty lips
were moving all the time."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"It was a noise, mother&mdash;a trumpet sounding through the house&mdash;dead
leaves, white leaves flying all about me; then, mother, then immense
heaps of snow rolling, heaving, and spreading everywhere. I&mdash;I cannot
remember how I got in or out of this cold whiteness. It seemed to bury
me in a long sleep."</p>

<p>"Poor child&mdash;poor little Katharine."</p>

<p>"Oh, I remember you called me that when I was a very small child."</p>

<p>"Katharine, try; can you remember nothing more?"</p>

<p>"Nothing more, only as one recollects that she has been miserably
asleep."</p>

<p>"But it was in this time, while I was away to see about that wood, that
our baby was killed."</p>

<p>"Killed!&mdash;how?"</p>

<p>"Strangled."</p>

<p>"Mother&mdash;mother!"</p>

<p>The anguish of this cry made the poor woman tremble; but she must speak
out all her fearful knowledge or her daughter would never be prepared
for the future.</p>

<p>"Mother, tell me&mdash;tell me!"</p>

<p>The poor young creature lay gasping upon her pillow. It was a terrible
scene to witness.</p>

<p>"It had been strangled or smothered, and buried deep in the snow, by the
rocks under the butternut tree, half way to Mr. Thrasher's."</p>

<p>"There&mdash;there in sight of his father's house!"</p>

<p>She writhed in anguish on her bed, weak, fragile, tortured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span> it seemed
as if she must die before another shock reached her.</p>

<p>"Dead&mdash;buried in the snow," she kept repeating.</p>

<p>The mother knelt by the bed, holding forth her arms, which the wretched
girl could not see.</p>

<p>"Ask God to give you strength, Katharine."</p>

<p>"You ask him for me, mother; my heart aches so."</p>

<p>"Oh, Katharine, we have greater trouble yet to come."</p>

<p>"Greater trouble than the death of one's little babe&mdash;that can never
be!" Katharine answered with pathetic pain. "No, no, mother, that can
never be!"</p>

<p>"Katharine, the neighbors believe that&mdash;" she paused, put a hand to her
throat, as if the words strangled her, and went on in a voice so near a
whisper that it sounded unearthly, "believe that you killed the child."</p>

<p>"Kill my child! Did they know I was its mother?"</p>

<p>"Killed and buried it with your own hands in the snow," persisted the
woman, drearily. "This is what they charge you with, my daughter."</p>

<p>"No, no, mother!"</p>

<p>"A jury have decided so."</p>

<p>"A jury! What cruel thing is that?"</p>

<p>"It is a court."</p>

<p>"A court! What was that for?"</p>

<p>"To say if you were innocent&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Guilty of murdering my own baby&mdash;his and mine! Do the neighbors want a
court to prove that of me?"</p>

<p>"It has been held, Katharine, here under my roof."</p>

<p>"Held here?"</p>

<p>"And that is why we are never alone."</p>

<p>"That man&mdash;you mean that man!" cried Katharine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span> shrinking back in the
bed with a look of affright. "Did the neighbors put him here to watch
me? Why?"</p>

<p>"They fear you will attempt to escape!"</p>

<p>"Escape where? Is not this my home?"</p>

<p>The old woman wrung her hands in bitter agony. This scene was racking
every nerve in her body. That young creature had not fully comprehended
that which no mother living could have told. All her own strength was
exhausted&mdash;she had no fortitude left. Katharine lay with her great, wild
eyes searching her mother's face, as it fell helplessly downward upon
her bosom.</p>

<p>"Mother, if the neighbors believe this, what will they do to me?"</p>

<p>"Kill you, my poor lamb!" the woman whispered.</p>

<p>Katharine did not seem to feel this so keenly as other things that had
been said; it was beyond her comprehension&mdash;she could not realize it.</p>

<p>"No, mother, that can never be. God knows all things!"</p>

<p>The young creature almost smiled as she said this, and closing her eyes
turned her face to the wall.</p>

<p>It was strange that, in all her trouble, she never once alluded to
Thrasher with an idea of protection, or seemed to have any hope of
succor from him. The letter he had sent left no impression on her
memory, but some more subtle intuition possessed her soul, and this
secret second-sense held all hope in check. This half supernatural
feeling also had doubtless given vague after-shadowings of her child's
death without absolutely awakening her consciousness, for when the
terrible truth was revealed to her she seemed struggling to remember
something that had gone before.</p>

<p>Thus the real and the visionary were so mingled in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span> her mind that a true
realization of her danger was impossible, and knowing her innocence, a
sweet trust in the Divine justice sprang up in her soul, keeping out all
fear.</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="xxxiii" id="xxxiii"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">THE OLD COUPLE ON THEIR SHADOWED HEARTH-STONE.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the days that had followed Katharine Allen's arrest&mdash;days so
terrible that their memory could never die wholly out of the
neighborhood&mdash;the old couple in the farm house beyond the widow Allen's
dwelling, bore their full share of the horror and grief which oppressed
all who had known and loved the girl.</p>

<p>But both Mr. Thrasher and his wife were bowed beneath a deeper sorrow
than mere commiseration for one unfortunate creature&mdash;beneath a horror
more painful than any thought of her sin.</p>

<p>For a time neither spoke of it. They avoided looking in each other's
face&mdash;those true hearts that had never had a secret before&mdash;lest the
fear that haunted their minds should find utterance in their eyes.</p>

<p>One night, as they sat by the kitchen fire, the old lady mechanically
knitting, and her husband looking mournfully into the cheerful blaze,
her thoughts found an almost unconscious utterance.</p>

<p>"Oh, if I could only be certain&mdash;if Nelson was only here to answer for
himself."</p>

<p>Mr. Thrasher glanced quickly at her, then back into the fire, while the
old lady let her work fall, and sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span> with her hands clasped in her lap,
that mild, womanly face darkened by a deeper shadow than it had ever
before worn.</p>

<p>"If I could send for him, I would," replied Mr. Thrasher, with a
sternness his voice seldom took in addressing his wife. "I don't want to
believe wrong of any one, but if he were here, I'd question him."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't," broke in the mother; "my heart would break if I was sure
of it."</p>

<p>"It's a black thing," continued he, taking no notice of her remark,
although the nervous twitching about his mouth, and the tremulous
movement of his hands, proved that he had heard and shared in her
feelings. "If I could look him in the eyes," he continued, the sternness
creeping over his face again, "I should be answered."</p>

<p>"Don't think harshly of him!" returned his wife. "Don't do that! If we
were to hear he was dead, remember how we should blame ourselves for any
wrong feeling."</p>

<p>"I would rather see him lying dead yonder, where he used to sit, than
know that he had tempted that poor girl into sin."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. But don't talk in that way, father; don't look like that!
I feel as if it wasn't you, with that frown on your face."</p>

<p>She put out her hand and took his. He clasped his hard fingers about
hers with the faithful love of a lifetime; but the determination and
gloom did not leave his features.</p>

<p>"I want to go down to the house," pursued the old lady, "but I've put it
off&mdash;I hadn't the courage, somehow."</p>

<p>"Nor I," replied Mr. Thrasher; "but isn't it a dreadful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span> thing when we
are dreading to ask questions, for fear we should stand face to face
with our son's crime?"</p>

<p>"No, no, I don't believe it! I won't believe it, father! Such cruel
words are unbecoming his parents!"</p>

<p>"I don't mean to be cruel to you or him, wife. Was I ever so?"</p>

<p>"Never! You have been one of the best husbands that ever lived."</p>

<p>She could not longer keep back her tears&mdash;they rolled down her cheeks,
and fell, drop by drop, on her apron.</p>

<p>"I must go to the house," she said; "who knows but what Mrs. Allen is
all alone. I feel as if I had been hard-hearted in not going before."</p>

<p>"You'd better go," he answered. "Yes; it's your duty."</p>

<p>"I thought of asking you to go with me, if you don't mind. I should have
more courage with you by my side."</p>

<p>Mr. Thrasher was silent for a moment, then he said:</p>

<p>"Yes; we will go to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>They put the subject aside; nor was it again resumed. The chapter in the
Bible was read, the prayer was uttered&mdash;no trouble could make those
hearts forget that duty&mdash;and, in their affliction, they only turned more
earnestly toward the help and comfort of their whole lives.</p>

<p>The next morning, when breakfast was over, and the work for the forenoon
arranged, the husband and wife took their way down the hill toward Mrs.
Allen's house, keeping close together, as if great comfort lay in that
silent companionship.</p>

<p>When they reached the gate, both paused, looking, anxiously at each
other; when Mr. Thrasher saw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span> pale trouble which agitated his wife,
he tried to say a few comforting words, but they broke on his lips.</p>

<p>He opened the gate, and they passed up the walk to the house. Mr.
Thrasher knocked, but there was no response; a second time, but no
better success.</p>

<p>"Maybe we might go in," whispered his wife, but he shook his head, and
again tapped upon the door.</p>

<p>After another instant of suspense, which seemed very long to them, they
heard footsteps, the latch was lifted from within, the door slowly
opened, and Mrs. Allen stood before them, so changed by those terrible
days, that the old friends of years could hardly feel that it was her.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Allen saw who stood there, she started a little, and the old
pride gathered slowly over the anguish of her face.</p>

<p>"We&mdash;we came to ask how Katharine is," Mrs. Thrasher said, faintly,
taking it upon herself to break the silence.</p>

<p>"She is better," returned the widow, neither moving to give them
entrance, or turning her eyes from that steady gaze.</p>

<p>"Do you think I could see her?" persisted the old lady, trembling all
over and ready to cry aloud.</p>

<p>"Nobody sees her but the doctor," replied Mrs. Allen.</p>

<p>"I thought maybe I could do something&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There isn't any thing to do."</p>

<p>Then there was another awkward silence, which Mrs. Thrasher broke, with
a timidity which she could hardly overcome.</p>

<p>"I should like to see Katharine," she said, "very, very much."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
"She cannot see any one now&mdash;it is forbidden."</p>

<p>There were a few more faint remarks from Mrs. Thrasher, then the pair
turned away. Mrs. Allen closed the door, they walked silently out of the
yard and back toward their house, which had never appeared so cheerless
to them.</p>

<p>As they passed the butternut tree both the old people turned away their
heads, for the remembrance of that morning when they stood together and
watched their son making signals from that very spot, for the wretched
prisoner to whose presence they had been denied not half an hour before,
filled their hearts with sensations which neither of them could ever
express.</p>

<p>It was a mournful thing to see those two good souls in their bungling
efforts to cheat each other into a belief that no terrible sorrow had
fallen upon them. It was all a sad, sad failure.</p>

<br />
<span class="sub">THE SNOW FRESHET.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was rare confusion and riot at the red school-house. The weather
had changed suddenly, the wind blew from the south, the sun lay warm and
dazzling upon the snow-drifts; but its treacherous kisses subdued their
cold strength and wasted their beauty.</p>

<p>At last it settled into a regular "thaw"&mdash;a New England one at that.
From the mud, a stranger might have thought the very foundations of the
earth had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span> ploughed up. Every snow bank dissolved itself into a
pert little rivulet, that swelled the general tide, and formed a muddy
lake on each side of the road, along which horses and men passed so
bespattered and stained that one could easily believe they had been
formed entirely from clay, and were fast resolving themselves back to
the original element.</p>

<p>A tiny brook, that died out in dry weather and sprung to existence on
rainy days, ran along one end of the school-house. It had slept quietly
for weeks under its icy bridge, but woke up with great commotion as
thousands of tiny streams flowed down from the hills, and poured their
excited little wavelets into its channel, swelling the brook to such a
size that it evidently believed itself a stupendous sort of river. It
must have been so; nothing but that idea very firmly impressed, could
ever have excused the reckless conduct of that overgrown brook.</p>

<p>It raved, and scolded, and tore along its banks, tumbling the great
stones about, uprooting the poor little frozen shrubs that had clung in
fancied security to its brink. Fuming, splashing, and rioting madly
across the road, the brook plunged down a gully at one end of the
school-house, and set up a famous little waterfall on its own account.
Then, rampant and muddy, it hurled itself forward, melting the snow as
it went, and pouring over a high bank of the river, plunged in with
tumultuous violence, making the deeper and slower stream swell, and
eddy, and fume for a whole minute as it swallowed up the noisy affair.</p>

<p>The rush of this brook reached the boys caged up in the school-house,
and nearly drove them frantic. They could hear the snow sliding off the
roof of the school-house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span> and fall in heaps under the eaves, which
dripped with incessant moisture. Now and then came a crash of icicles,
breaking up the sunshine like splintered diamonds, and scattering broken
fragments of crystal all over the snow.</p>

<p>This riot of waters and crashing of ice were enough to disorganize the
best school in New England. The boys might be kept on the hard benches;
but no power on earth would tame them down to real study. There they
sat, burning with impatience, yet trying their best to look studious and
quiet, whenever the master's eyes were upon them.</p>

<p>For some reason, there was to be a half holiday that afternoon, and the
poor little sinners waited as restlessly as so many wild pigeons, with
their wings tied, for the hour which should contain their release.</p>

<p>A plan of operation for the afternoon had been already decided upon&mdash;I
do not think there was one dissenting voice&mdash;and of all the fun which
the whole year might bring there would be nothing equal to that which
they anticipated as soon as the school was dismissed.</p>

<p>But it really seemed as if twelve o'clock never would come! Those boys
began to think, one and all, that the master had never been so slow in
hearing the lessons. At last he became so irritated by their
restlessness and inattention, that great fears arose that the holiday
might be lost altogether.</p>

<p>When that horrible prophecy was whispered about&mdash;it originated with an
unhappy-looking little Belshazzar, who was afflicted with a step-father,
and who, from the vast stores of his experience, was always ready to
draw out sorrowful warnings&mdash;I say, when it got whispered about, several
of the larger boys nodded their heads at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span> each other and looked
ferociously rebellious, while the little ones eyed them with profound
admiration. Just at that moment, the master's hand glided softly toward
the great ferule that lay upon his desk; and somehow, at that sight, the
mutineers became wonderfully interested in their lessons, and their
small admirers retreated into their spelling-books so far that there
seemed danger of their disappearing altogether.</p>

<p>The moment came at last. The master pulled out his silver watch, which
ticked so loud and wrathfully that it could be heard all over the
room&mdash;glanced at it, while every boy held his breath with anxiety. He
waited an instant, in order to give due solemnity to the occasion, then
down came the ferule on the desk with a grand crash. School was
dismissed.</p>

<p>Out rushed the boys, tumbling over each other in hot haste, shrieking,
hallooing, and plunging into the snow with shouts of eager delight. Even
Belshazzar forgot his forebodings, and was foremost in this race after
fun.</p>

<p>The teacher, a kind, elderly man, went to the school-house door and
watched the tumult benignly from beneath the steel-bowed spectacles that
had been hastily thrust across his forehead. His face, which had been
severe, in a strained effort to keep up the dignity of his school, now
beamed with infinite satisfaction, and rubbing his hands gleefully, he
was sorely tempted to take a share in the fun himself. Damming up a
torrent like that which came tumbling across the road, was something
worth while, even for a man.</p>

<p>The boys rushed down to the swollen brook where it entered the gulley
and made a tumultuous descent to the river, which was only concealed
from the bulk windows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span> of the school-house by a growth of young hemlocks
that contrasted richly with the crusted snow. Here the boys were bound
to make a dam big enough to drown a fellow in, neck and heels. Who cared
for the mud? Who was afraid of the snow? Hurrah! hurrah! come on all
hands and pitch in. There is a broken rail. Look out for the loose
stones in that tumble-down, old wall. Bring up drift wood from the
river, dead branches from the trees; tear loads of moss from the white
oak stumps; bring any thing, every thing. Had any boy pluck enough to
drag out some logs from the school wood pile? "Oh, golly! there is the
master standing square in the door, and little Paul, the furrener,
talking to him. Hurrah! the master is sending him off to join the fun.
Isn't he a trump?"</p>

<p>Some of the boys stood still, knee deep in the water, frightened half to
death by that wicked word&mdash;trump. But Tom Hutchins cried out with
wonderful audacity, "Trump! who'se afeard? He's a high, low, jack, and
the game, he is! There he goes into the school-house just to give us a
chance at the wood pile. Come on, boys!"</p>

<p>Away the little fellows went, leaping like deer out of the mud, and
directly a whole team of boys came dragging a walnut log through the
snow, leaving a deep path all the way from the wood pile, which the
master never could be made to see, spectacles or no spectacles, anymore
than he could hear the tumbling logs close under the window where he was
sitting. I am inclined to think the boys were right, and that old man
was a trump, though he did belong to the church.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! stand from under," said Tom Hutchins, looking down upon a swarm
of schoolmates who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span> busy as bees in the mud and water of the gully.
"Here comes the crowner&mdash;A number one, and no mistake. Come up here and
give a boost, you chaps."</p>

<p>The boys sprang up the muddy sides of the gully, dripping like
water-gods, reckless of wet jackets, torn trowsers, and shoes from which
the water came up in gushes, and helped pitch that great, knotty log end
foremost into the gully, where it was to form a line for the water to
sweep over.</p>

<p>"Take it by the end&mdash;lift all at once&mdash;now, heave all together. Hurrah!
hurrah!"</p>

<p>Paul had, indeed, lingered around the school-house door till the master
sent him off to join the play. Then he went down to the brook and stood
disconsolate on its high bank, as all this wild fun went on. He was cold
and confused. No one asked him to help dam up the brook, so he stood in
the snow, buried to the ears in his overcoat and comforter, and thinking
that the watery sunshine was a very poor imitation of the tropical
warmth in which he had formerly luxuriated.</p>

<p>He was at a loss how to take part in their play; besides that, the very
roar of the water, and riot of the boys, reminded him of that fearful
night when he was made an orphan, and so recalled his sufferings, that
he longed to get beyond the sound. As for the boys, they were all too
much engaged to notice his abstraction or ask his assistance.</p>

<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
<a name="xxxv" id="xxxv"></a>CHAPTER XXXV.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">ALL SORTS OF TREASON.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> done a little injustice to Tom Hutchins&mdash;the warm-hearted lad who
had been so in love with little Rose Mason, and was sure to be in love
with every boy or girl who awoke his admiration, or needed his help. It
was he who had proposed to draw Paul home on his sled, on his first
lonely school day, and since that time a warm friendship had sprung up
between the two lads. The first liking had been cemented by an exchange
of doughnuts, wonder cakes, and red-cheeked apples. Then Tom had
undertaken to teach Paul English in conversational lessons, and picked
up a few scraps of French from the boy, fairly believing himself to be
speaking a foreign language when he twisted his hard, New England tongue
into imitations of Paul's pretty broken English, in which the boy could
now make himself understood.</p>

<p>In the midst of his eager work on the dam, Tom saw Paul standing alone
on the bank and called to him. But Paul shook his head, with a sad
smile, and shrunk further away from the water. Then Tom gave one great
heave at the log which was to complete the dam, shook the mud from his
hands, and went dripping up the bank, with his face all aglow, and
smiling as if he had just come out of a spring shower, and was inviting
his friend down to watch the wild flowers start up in his track.</p>

<p>"Are you cold, Paul?" he asked, dancing about till the water splashed
over the tops of his boots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
"A little," Paul said, shivering. "Only a little."</p>

<p>"Why, it's a'most like summer," returned Tom. "Splendid."</p>

<p>"Is it?" Paul asked, shivering worse than ever, as he thought what a
forlorn idea of summer people must have in that frigid land.</p>

<p>"Why, how you do shiver," cried Tom. "Let's take a run up the hill and
back, or you'll freeze solid."</p>

<p>"But you want to play," Paul said; "go with the boys, they are calling
for you."</p>

<p>"Let 'em," replied Tom, philosophically, consoled at once by the idea
that his playmates needed his assistance, and too full of generous
kindness for any thought of leaving Paul to his loneliness. "Come
along&mdash;let's see who'll get to the top first."</p>

<p>At the conclusion of their race Paul had got a color in his cheeks, and
felt somewhat less like an icicle than before.</p>

<p>Then Tom paused, and looked Paul in the face quite seriously.</p>

<p>"Come down here among the hemlocks; I want to talk to you where the boys
can't hear. We might do it in French, you know&mdash;you and I&mdash;but mebby
we'd better have it out according to the spelling-book."</p>

<p>Paul smiled, and followed his friend to the bank of the river, where
they sat down under the sheltering hemlock boughs. Tom shivered a
little, but he shook the weakness off, and broke forth at once into the
subject that was on his mind.</p>

<p>Tom's head was full of Katharine Allen and her troubles, a subject upon
which he and Paul had held many earnest conversations, interspersed by
mysterious hints about Rose Mason and Tom's unhappy state of mind
regarding her absence in some unknown country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
"Paul, how is Katharine Allen this morning?" he said, abruptly.</p>

<p>Paul shook his head sadly by way of answer.</p>

<p>"Not any better?" asked Tom. "Wal, I'm sorry for her, anyhow. Little
Rose liked her, and she was always good to Rose. It scares me to death
to think what they're going to do to her."</p>

<p>"Who?" asked Paul.</p>

<p>"Why the law, of course," replied Tom, shocked at his friend's
ignorance. "You know they're going to take her to prison as soon as
she's well enough to be carried there."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. They are wicked men, too wicked," exclaimed Paul; "why
can't they leave her alone?"</p>

<p>"You mustn't say any thing agin the squire," returned Tom, with his New
England respect for the law and its ministers. "I'm sorry for her, but
you see she kinder killed the baby, poor little critter&mdash;I guess she was
crazy, though, I do, but marm won't hear on it."</p>

<p>"Why don't her husband come and help her," Paul suggested.</p>

<p>"She haint got any&mdash;oh, dear no, that's the worst on it, marm says."</p>

<p>"Oh, she must have."</p>

<p>"Oh, must she!" retorted Tom, exulting in his knowledge of this world's
wickedness, gained from conversations he had overheard concerning the
poor girl, yet perplexed, and quite unable to settle the matter to his
own satisfaction. Still he had no intention of allowing Paul to suppose
that his wisdom was more than half assumed.</p>

<p>"I'm glad Miss Rose ain't here, anyhow," he observed; "she'd break her
heart about all this. I know she would."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
Paul thought the girl's heart must be colder than the weather if it
would not have that effect, and nodded his approbation of Tom's
sentiment.</p>

<p>"Katharine is getting stronger; they talk of carrying her off in a day
or two," continued Tom. "I heard our folks say so this morning."</p>

<p>Paul's great eyes dimmed with tears, then a quick passion turned them
into fire.</p>

<p>"I could kill them," he said. "Yes, I could."</p>

<p>"'Twouldn't be no use," remarked Tom, sapiently; "'cause they'd only
take you off too. I wish we could do something, though&mdash;I wish we
could."</p>

<p>"Can't we?" questioned Paul, his face kindling with eagerness. "Oh,
don't you think we could?"</p>

<p>"You're such a little bit of a chap," Tom replied, eyeing his companion,
with a natural exultation at his own superiority in point of inches and
weight.</p>

<p>"I'm little," Paul said, "but I am very brave&mdash;oh, you don't know! And
Jube&mdash;Jube is strong like a lion, he could do any thing."</p>

<p>"I wonder if she couldn't run away," Tom burst out, quite overcome by
his own inspiration. "I don't suppose she could run, you know, but she
might get away."</p>

<p>"And we could help," Paul said, his quick intelligence seizing at once
upon the suggestion; "I am sure we could."</p>

<p>"Why, my marm would kill me!" exclaimed Tom. "Wouldn't I ketch it, oh,
my!"</p>

<p>"You would beg and pray," said Paul; "she could not refuse&mdash;she would be
willing."</p>

<p>"Wal, I guess we wouldn't ask her&mdash;'tain't disobeyin' when you hain't
been told not to do a thing, and nobody can tell you what to do when
they never heerd of it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Tom got dreadfully bewildered in his labyrinth of negatives and Paul was
unable to make much of his speech, but he was certain that it harmonized
with his own ideas, even if he did fail to comprehend its entire
signification.</p>

<p>"We could help her," he kept repeating; "I am sure we could."</p>

<p>"I do wonder what the squire would say?" said Tom, giggling at the very
idea, although somewhat frightened at its audacity. "Wouldn't there be a
rumpus&mdash;oh, my golly!"</p>

<p>He laughed outright, and Paul joined him from sympathy with that merry
face; but he became thoughtful again in a moment.</p>

<p>"You are certain they would take her away from home and lock her up in
that dark, lonesome place you call a prison?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Sure as a gun. Par says so, and he knows the squires and lawyers about
here all to pieces; but that aint the worst of it, not by a jug full."</p>

<p>The good-hearted little fellow's voice began to choke in his throat, and
he burst into a laugh to keep from sobbing outright.</p>

<p>"What can be worse than that?" inquired Paul, startled by his friend's
demonstration.</p>

<p>"They'll kill her!"</p>

<p>Paul turned deadly pale. The horror in Tom's words had struck him dumb.</p>

<p>"They'll hang her up on a gallows made of two high posts, with a
cross-bar on the top," continued Tom, shuddering at his own words, "and
a halter fastened to the cross-bar, which they will tie round her pretty
white neck, that Rose used to hug so much."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
"Don't, oh, don't!" whispered Paul, putting up his hands; "it makes me
tremble all over."</p>

<p>"And so it does me," cried Tom, dashing the tears from his blue eyes.
"But you ought to know it just as it is, the burning brand and all."</p>

<p>"The burning brand&mdash;what is that?" asked Paul, faintly.</p>

<p>"The hot iron that they stamp M&mdash;that's for murderer, you know&mdash;on her
hand!"</p>

<p>"Oh, me!" sighed Paul. "That petite white hand!"</p>

<p>"Sometimes the courts do that, and let 'em live in Simsbury all the rest
of their lives. Sometimes they hang 'em right up. I don't know which
they'll do to her."</p>

<p>"But they will do some of these awful things?" questioned Paul,
breathing as if he was chilled through with the cold.</p>

<p>"Of course, they've got to do it. The law won't let 'em back out if they
wanted to."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, it makes me feel so wicked," cried Paul, brave thoughts
kindling through the pallor of his face. "I want to cry and strike
somebody at the same time."</p>

<p>"Strike! I want to maul some of 'em! Oh, if them courts was only little
boys, and I the law, wouldn't they come down on their marrow bones and
beg her pardon for thinking of such a thing. Besides, do you see, Paul,
I don't believe she killed the baby. Anyway, them little creatures, with
long flannel petticoats a hanging over their feet, are always doing
things to torment grown folks, catching the rash, and measles, and
chickenpox, to say nothing of a habit they get into of hiccuping right
in a feller's face when he's told to tend 'em. Babies! They're the only
thing I ever raly had agin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span> marm&mdash;she always would be keeping one on
hand, just for us to rock, and tend, and hush up. Par never would make a
fuss about it, as a man aught ter with such goings on in the house."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he rather liked them!" suggested Paul.</p>

<p>"Liked 'em. Well, maybe he did, there's no saying; besides, they're well
enough in their place, and that, according to my notion, is sound asleep
in the cradle. Anyhow, what's the use of making sich a time about it
when one of 'em stops crying for good and all, and what on airth could
anybody think that ere young gal wanted with one of 'em a tagging after
her?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Paul, tenderly; "but from the way she looks at
the empty cradle sometimes, it seems to me as if she wanted it there
very much."</p>

<p>"Of course she does. It's a way of the wimmen folks have. I don't know
about marm, for our cradle never is empty; but some wimmen make such
fools of themselves, it's enough to set a feller agin the whole pack and
boodle on 'em."</p>

<p>"You don't mean all the beautiful ladies," said Paul, thinking sadly of
his own sweet mother.</p>

<p>"There's marm&mdash;she's a purty good kind of a woman after all, and Miss
Mason, harnsome as a pictur. Then, little Rose&mdash;oh, my! don't you wish
you could see her, with her white aprons ruffled all around, and her
long curls, just like a wax doll. But then the generality of 'em&mdash;well,
I don't want to say nothin'."</p>

<p>"That was a very nice little lady that gave me one apple with the brown
coat."</p>

<p>"She? yes, she'll do; but we're going off the handle, you and I. What's
the good of talking about the best on 'em if Katharine Allen has got to
be hung! As I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span> was a saying&mdash;when you would go on about wimmen folks in
gineral, as if I cared any thing about them&mdash;as I was a saying, she
never hurt that baby no more than I did. It went off and buried itself
up in the snow&mdash;stealing Katy's shawl to wrap itself up in, then took
cold and went into a conniption fit just out of spite. Them little
sojers are up to all sorts of tricks; don't I know 'em!"</p>

<p>"I am sure it died of its own accord," said Paul.</p>

<p>"Of course; anybody but a squire would a found that out long ago."</p>

<p>"And she would be much glad to have the little baby back again."</p>

<p>"Wall, I don't know about that," said Tom, shaking his head doubtfully;
"Katharine Allen's got some sense, I reckon; squalling must come
unnatral in that ar house&mdash;now I leave it to you."</p>

<p>"But they will hang her dead."</p>

<p>"No doubt about it."</p>

<p>"Or burn her poor petite hand."</p>

<p>"Both on 'em, for all what I know, without you and I stand up to the
rack like men, and tell the laws, and squires, and constables to go to
old scratch."</p>

<p>"What is old scratch?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't just know; but he's a feller that's always about times
like this."</p>

<p>"But hadn't we better let the laws, and the squires, and all the rest
alone, and try very much to help her?" suggested Paul.</p>

<p>"In course we had; I only threw them in sort of promiscuous. Now I'll
tell you what my idee is: Katharine is getting stronger every day, you
know."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Paul; "she sat up in a chair this morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span> and eat very
little <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>&mdash;breakfast, I mean&mdash;and the man&mdash;that great big man
that sits on the hearth always&mdash;said she was getting much strong, and
the window is too near the ground&mdash;not safe."</p>

<p>"Did he say that?" inquired Tom, breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Yes; the man said that. Then madame&mdash;that is the old mother&mdash;she look
frightened very much, and said, no take the poor sick child away too
soon. Then the man said up-stairs was best&mdash;high from ground, very
sure."</p>

<p>"That's bad," muttered Tom. "Ladders are scarce and heavy to lift."</p>

<p>"So," continued Paul, "they move my bed into another room, and take up
many things for her, because the man thinks it sure."</p>

<p>"Well," cried Tom, coming out in force, "'what can't be cured must be
endured,' as par says. There may be a ladder about Mrs. Allen's
premises. To-morrow morning, when I come after you, we'll just take a
survey there. About that cuffy friend of yourn, I want to have some talk
with him. When there's ladders to be used, I'm afraid you and I couldn't
come quite up to the scratch."</p>

<p>"But Jube, Jube he come right up to old scratch for us&mdash;very strong
Jube&mdash;very brave, like lion."</p>

<p>"You're sartin that cuffy would do it; that he wouldn't slump through?"</p>

<p>"What, Jube? oh, yes, he do any thing I say; very good Jube, never
slump."</p>

<p>"Well, then, we're a hull team, you and I and the nigger. Yes, and a
hoss to let. If we don't get Katy Allen out of that end window, I don't
know what's what; but, then, what are we to do with her when that's
done?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
Paul shook his head in sudden despondency.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, where can we go?"</p>

<p>Tom folded his arms and drooped his head. Here was a difficulty which he
hadn't thought of before.</p>

<p>All at once Paul brightened up.</p>

<p>"We will take her to New York. If David Rice is there he'll be very
good, and so glad Jube and we did it for his sister."</p>

<p>"Yes," cried Tom, "That's a genuine idee. I'll hook par's yaller wagon
and drive down to the sloop atween two days, they'll never think of
searching aboard a sloop. But oh, golly, golly, here's a fix. It takes
money to travel in that ere genteel way, and I haint got more'n a
ninepence on earth."</p>

<p>"Money?" cried Paul, eagerly. "What you call gold with the king's head
on it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know about gold, never saw none of that ere money. What I mean
is silver with a spread-eagle on one side and a woman's head on
t'other."</p>

<p>"I am sure that gold is money," said Paul, recovering from his first
look of disappointment, "for Jube gave it to the people as we came
along, and they gave him back silver like that you speak of, more pieces
than the gold, oh very much."</p>

<p>"And how much have you got?"</p>

<p>Paul put his delicate hands together.</p>

<p>"So much full, three, four, five times."</p>

<p>Tom emitted a low whistle. "Oh, golly, that's up to chalk, and you're
sartin the tavern keepers and captains gave you silver money for it?"</p>

<p>"Sure I saw."</p>

<p>"And Jube will shell out&mdash;no mistake about that, ha?"</p>

<p>"Jube what?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
"'ll hand over," persisted Tom, counting imaginary gold into his palm.</p>

<p>"What, give the money?"</p>

<p>"Yes; chink!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;sure."</p>

<p>"Then we're sot up in business. Three stout fellers, saddles lying about
loose in some barn or other, yaller wagon standing ready, harness
chucked under the seat, horses whinnering to be druv, and that ere poor
gal ready to jump out of the window when we say the word. Now, Paul,
this is just what you must do. Get the nigger&mdash;I mean our friend
Jube&mdash;for when a darkey has his double hands full of chink to do as he
pleases with, he's got a right to be treated like folks, for that makes
him an individual; get him ready to toe the mark when we give the word.
Jest tell her that Tom&mdash;she knows me&mdash;is on hand, and working for her
like sixty, and just the minute she's well enough to cut, we'll have her
out of that winder. Then you sleep with one eye open, and tell me every
word that officer says."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Paul, "I'll do every thing; but hadn't we better say
something to madam?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean Mrs. Allen?" answered Tom, dropping his chin into the
hollow of one hand, in a thoughtful way. "No; I should rather say not.
She's got strict notions about things, and might put the wrong spoke
into our wheel. Now, if I was going to tell anybody, it would be the
doctor; he's clear grit, he is, and wouldn't stop us if we run through
his own home lot with that ere gal. Ketch him telling."</p>

<p>By this time the boys were chilled through with standing in the wet and
cold. Tom's teeth chattered in his head as he uttered this encomium on
the doctor, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span> was the most popular person among the juveniles in all
the neighborhood, and Paul shivered in his garments like a tropical bird
brought into the midst of a foreign winter. Besides, the boys had
conquered the brook, which was storming its way to the river over a pile
of stones and rubbish, which he triumphantly pronounced the finest dam
that had ever been built on this side of creation; and Tom, though a
philosopher, philanthropist, and hero, loved fun above all. So away he
started, shouting hurrah, and made a rush clear through the turbulent
waters of the brook, just to let the boys know that he hadn't been
shirking; but amid all the noise and fun, he resolved to be faithful to
his young confederate, and only hold council with the true-hearted
negro.</p>

<p>As Paul went toiling up the hill that day, he saw Jube coming toward
him&mdash;a circumstance that often happened on his way from school. How his
beautiful face kindled up at the sight of his friend. His pace
quickened, and the trouble went out from his eyes as he held out the
little, cold hand, in its wet mitten, for Jube to lead him home, as
usual.</p>

<p>Jube drew off the mitten, and took the chilled hand in his broad palm,
caressing it as if it had been a bird.</p>

<br />
<span class="sub">MRS. MASON AT HER STUDIES.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Several</span> months had passed since the arrival of Mrs. Mason at the
minister's house, in Bays Hollow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
During that time she had not been idle. When she placed herself under
the quiet lady's instruction, she had announced that she wished to make
all the progress possible and turn every moment to account&mdash;truly, she
had done so.</p>

<p>Had the woman kept some good design in view, the assiduity with which
she labored would have done her honor&mdash;as it was, vanity took the place
of any better motive and perhaps was the strongest incentive which a
nature like hers could have felt.</p>

<p>The facility with which she gained a knowledge of things astonished the
minister's wife, whose education was thorough and solid, yet Mrs. Mason
made far more show with her little accomplishments than her instructress
could with all her learning. She had an excellent verbal memory, was
quick to seize every movement or expression, and as Mrs. Prior was a
true lady she could not have had a better model.</p>

<p>Among the gifts with which Thrasher had presented Mrs. Mason, there were
many articles of which she did not know the use or even the name, but
nobody would ever have dreamed it&mdash;she gained the knowledge so adroitly
from Mrs. Prior, that the little woman had an unpleasant feeling that
the wealthy Southerner considered her very ignorant, and desired to
enlighten her.</p>

<p>She did wonders in her French lessons&mdash;she promised to make a showy,
dashing performer upon the piano, and her quick ear taught her speedily
to regulate any little inaccuracies of speech by the correct, although
sometimes formal language, of her companion.</p>

<p>Yet she carried it all off with so lofty an air, that her teacher often
felt that she was the only person instructed. She corrected herself with
so much assurance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span> and dignity that Mrs. Prior would color modestly,
almost inclined to believe that it was she who had been guilty of false
syntax, and that the stately lady opposite had set her right with
good-natured insolence.</p>

<p>In the box of books which Thrasher sent Mrs. Mason, there were a large
number of novels, principally French, and those she read with great
avidity, although there were many, after she began to read the language
with ease, which she did not think proper to display to the criticism of
her hostess.</p>

<p>The little parlor had assumed quite a different aspect since the
introduction of the piano and various articles of furniture which Mrs.
Mason ordered from New York. Her own rooms were furnished with a degree
of elegance she had never seen equaled, yet from her manner one would
have thought she only endured their meagreness with the condescension of
one accustomed to a very different state of affairs.</p>

<p>Little Rose grew prettier every day, and made herself happy, as was
natural at her age. She became a great favorite with Mrs. Prior, and
even with the dreary clergyman. But beyond a certain point, Mrs. Mason
would not permit any intimacy to extend. She was jealous of Rose's
affection for the worthy pair, as she would have been at the idea of
sharing love with any one.</p>

<p>Neither the minister nor his wife were able to understand the character
of their inmate, but they felt a sort of repulsion in regard to her
which it was impossible to overcome, although they reproached themselves
as if they had been guilty of a deadly sin, but after all their
struggles they sunk back into the same unpleasant state of mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
The minister really felt uneasy while going through family worship in
her presence; not that she appeared irreverent, on the contrary, she was
as strict in her performance of such duties as the rest of the house,
but she acted all the while as if she were doing a great favor to all
concerned, even to the Being to whom she prayed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Prior knew very well that her pupil had not always been in
possession of the wealth which was evidently then under her control;
yet, as weeks wore on, and Mrs. Mason grew more stylish and elegant, the
little woman almost began to think that her first impressions had been
false and impertinent; that, on the whole, the lady had no need of
instruction, and only gave herself to study from the whim of the moment.</p>

<p>Every little graceful, lady-like way, every pretty habit of voice or
manner which the minister's wife possessed, did Mrs. Mason assume, only
she carried it off in such a showy manner that it appeared an original
grace of her own, and which Mrs. Prior was imitating in a modest fashion
and with indifferent success. In fact, it really seemed more as if the
minister's wife were a sort of humble pattern of her dashing companion
than as if Mrs. Mason had ever gained a hint from her.</p>

<p>One day the household was thrown into a gentle sort of confusion by the
arrival of a visitor for Mrs. Mason. He was an elegant and handsome man
as Mrs. Prior could have desired to see; but she shrunk instinctively
from him as she had always done from her guest.</p>

<p>The minister's wife left this strange man in the little parlor, and went
up to tell Mrs. Mason that some one desired to see her.</p>

<p>"Who, if you please?" the lady asked, negligently turning from her book,
as if troops of visitors had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span> an every-day occurrence in her life,
and were rather a bore than otherwise.</p>

<p>"Mr. Thrasher," replied the little person, still in a flutter.</p>

<p>"I will be down presently," was the answer; but still Mrs. Mason did not
rise from her seat, or lift her eyes from the book upon which they had
again fallen.</p>

<p>The door closed behind the bewildered lady; then Mrs. Mason sprang from
her seat and began a hasty, but careful toilet.</p>

<p>At the beginning of her residence in that house, Mrs. Mason would have
obscured and vulgarized her beauty by dress and ornaments unsuitable to
the hour or place. Mrs. Prior's remarks and her own observations had
already made her much wiser.</p>

<p>When she turned from the glass, there was an expression of triumph upon
her face which plainly betrayed a consciousness of her own surpassing
beauty.</p>

<p>She went down-stairs, opened the door of the room where Thrasher sat,
and glided in as self-possessed and elegant as any city belle of three
seasons, and a more dashingly beautiful woman you would not find in a
day's journey.</p>

<p>He started forward to meet her, his face flushed and lighted up with
excitement.</p>

<p>He caught Mrs. Mason's hand between both his own and faltered out an
almost timid greeting, very unlike the usual boldness of his manner.</p>

<p>"Are you well?" he asked. "Have you been well and contented?"</p>

<p>"A fine question, truly!" she replied, putting aside his eagerness with
a sort of unconcern very well assumed, and which evidently displeased
and pained him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
"As if any one could be contented shut up in a bird-cage."</p>

<p>"Have you been anxious to go away?" he questioned, as if hoping to
derive some comfort from her answer.</p>

<p>"I have not thought much about it; I find one thing which pleases me
greatly."</p>

<p>"And that?"</p>

<p>"Nobody interferes with me; I can do just what I like."</p>

<p>He frowned, although he appeared more troubled than annoyed.</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" she exclaimed, with an affected laugh. "What a face of
greeting for a man to wear&mdash;one might think you were a jailor, come to
announce that the day of my execution was at hand."</p>

<p>He dropped her wrist and turned away; she sank negligently into a chair,
in the very attitude she had admired in a picture of some forgotten
French marchioness, which embellished one of her favorite novels.</p>

<p>"I did not expect a welcome like this," he said, bitterly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mason looked at him with an expression of surprise which an actress
might have envied, and laughed again, not the hearty, ringing merriment
of old time, but a low, subdued sound, which did her infinite credit.</p>

<p>"In what have I been amiss?" she asked, coolly.</p>

<p>"I thought, at least, you would be glad to see me."</p>

<p>"Oh, did you? Upon my word, the vanity of mankind is beyond all belief!
Certainly, I am glad to see you"&mdash;he brightened at that&mdash;"quite so," she
added, with such carelessness that he looked more annoyed than before.</p>

<p>"This is abominable!" he exclaimed. "Ellen, I would not have believed
that you could treat me so."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
"Have you come here to lecture and find fault?" she asked, gayly. "Are
you sure that you have not made a mistake&mdash;wasn't it Rose you wished to
scold?"</p>

<p>"I did not come to find fault, Ellen. For weeks I have been crazy to see
you; nothing but your express commands kept me away; at last you wrote
that I might come; I hurried here, and now you are as cold and distant
as if I were a stranger."</p>

<p>"Poor boy, poor boy!"</p>

<p>She patted the hand which he had laid upon the arm of her chair, very
much as if it had been a pet lapdog.</p>

<p>Thrasher looked at her, overpowered by astonishment. Where had she
learned those arts&mdash;that playful manner? He had desired her to educate
and improve herself in every way; but here was a change beyond any thing
he could have expected.</p>

<p>"How handsome you have grown," he said, suddenly.</p>

<p>"You might as well tell me at once that I was a plain person before."</p>

<p>"You know I always thought you handsomer than any woman I had ever seen;
but you are really beautiful now."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mason smiled; her insatiable vanity was gratified by his words and
the glance of admiration that enforced them.</p>

<p>"Would you like to see Rose?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly; very much."</p>

<a name="xxxvii" id="xxxvii"></a>CHAPTER XXXVII.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">SETTLING THE WEDDING DAY.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mason</span> stepped into the hall, and called the little girl, who came
bounding gayly in; but when she saw Thrasher, an expression of dislike,
beyond her years, crossed her face, and she clung to her mother's side,
as if for protection.</p>

<p>"Won't you come and speak to me, Rose?" he asked.</p>

<p>Rose only clung closer to her mother, and hid her head in her dress.</p>

<p>"Go and speak to Mr. Thrasher, child," said Mrs. Mason. "How foolish you
are."</p>

<p>"Come, Rose, and see what I have got for you," he added; "such a pretty
present."</p>

<p>"I don't want any present," replied the child, her voice sounding
smothered and choked.</p>

<p>Thrasher looked so much displeased, that Mrs. Mason angrily commanded
the little girl to go and shake hands with him, though all the while she
had an evident enjoyment of his discomfiture.</p>

<p>"Do as I bid you, Rose, or I will shut you up for the day. Go, I am very
angry with you."</p>

<p>Thus commanded, the child raised her head, and walked slowly toward
Thrasher, still keeping her face averted.</p>

<p>He took her hand, spoke pleasantly, and tried to kiss her, but that she
would by no means permit.</p>

<p>"Are you sorry I have come, Rose?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, honestly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
"And you wont kiss me?"</p>

<p>"No; you can get me whipped if you want to, but it wont do any good. I
wont kiss anybody but my own pa when he comes."</p>

<p>"Rose, Rose!" expostulated her mother, losing a little of her bright
color.</p>

<p>"Obedience does not appear to be one of her virtues," Thrasher said,
smiling even through his agitation.</p>

<p>"I never saw her behave so before," replied Mrs. Mason; "she is
generally very tractable. Go out of the room, Rose, and don't speak to
me again to-day."</p>

<p>The child broke away from Thrasher, and ran out of the room with a loud
burst of sobs, leaving them both disconcerted.</p>

<p>"You should not have allowed her to dislike me so, Ellen," he said,
after an instant.</p>

<p>"Dear me, I cannot control the child's fancies. Do you think the whole
world must be in love with you?"</p>

<p>"I should be satisfied if I only felt certain that you cared for me,"
replied Thrasher, earnestly.</p>

<p>She rose and gave him a look of coquettish defiance.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" he asked.</p>

<p>"To call Mrs. Prior."</p>

<p>"What for, I should like to know?"</p>

<p>"To bring you back to your senses, of course."</p>

<p>"You will drive me out of them!" he exclaimed, catching her hand. "Do
listen to me, Ellen."</p>

<p>"Yes; well&mdash;I am listening."</p>

<p>"Tell me that you love me&mdash;even yet I cannot feel certain&mdash;you are so
restless, so capricious."</p>

<p>"Certainly I had better call Mrs. Prior."</p>

<p>"Hang Mrs. Prior."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
"That would be very cruel; besides, I should lose my French teacher."</p>

<p>"Let us start for Paris. You can finish your studies there."</p>

<p>"Thank you; I am quite comfortable where I am. I believe I am afraid of
the water."</p>

<p>"You! the bravest woman I ever met!"</p>

<p>"But I have reason to dread the sea."</p>

<p>This time there was no affectation in the shudder with which she broke
off&mdash;her husband's memory for a moment pierced even her vanity and
egotism like a blow. Thrasher grew pale with jealousy and a thousand
feelings more painful still.</p>

<p>"Let us think only of the future," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, what of that?" she asked, forcing those sad thoughts aside, and
becoming gay and selfish once more.</p>

<p>"Why should we wait for its happiness?" he continued. "I am rich, far
richer than you guess. We are both young. Marry me at once, Ellen, and
let us go away in search of pleasure and new scenes."</p>

<p>"Not yet," she answered. "I cannot."</p>

<p>"Why should we wait?"</p>

<p>"I will not be married until the year is up," she replied, more
seriously.</p>

<p>"You will die in this stupid place."</p>

<p>"I am used to quiet."</p>

<p>"But now you have had a glimpse of another life; you know what money can
do for you; your books have told you what a delightful life we might
lead in France or Italy."</p>

<p>"That may be, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What? You torment me on purpose to enjoy my distress! What were you
going to say?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
"I am not certain that I had better make any change in my life."</p>

<p>"Not make any change! Do you mean to treat me as if I were a child?"</p>

<p>"What a look! A reasonable woman would certainly hesitate about placing
herself in the power of a man with such a dreadful temper."</p>

<p>"You need have no fear on that score," he replied, subduing his passion.
"Nowhere in the world, Ellen, could you find a man so devoted and
patient as I would be. Remember how long I have loved you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now you are reminding me of my age."</p>

<p>"You are not old enough yet to dislike thinking of it."</p>

<p>"Well, what were you saying?"</p>

<p>Thrasher returned, and stood directly before her.</p>

<p>"Ellen," he said, firmly; "I will not be trifled with&mdash;I must have an
answer."</p>

<p>She looked up a little startled, thinking, perhaps, she had carried her
coquetry too far, but when she saw how troubled he looked, how his eyes
sunk under her own, she became certain again of her own power over him,
and with that security a desire to tease came back.</p>

<p>"I am not your slave," she replied; "how dare you address me in that
tone?"</p>

<p>"I did not mean to offend you."</p>

<p>"But you have offended me seriously; if you only came here to play the
tyrant, I would advise you to return at once."</p>

<p>It took many moments to make his peace, not that she was in the
slightest degree offended, but to a woman of her character there is
always great pleasure in the exercise of authority, no matter how petty
it may be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
"Then you will not promise to set my mind at rest?" he asked, after a
short period of more serious conversation.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I do not see why you should be otherwise than at rest now."</p>

<p>"You know I am not, Ellen; you know that I cannot be. At least name some
period when my suspense shall end."</p>

<p>"Not now; the next time you come, perhaps."</p>

<p>She could not bear to relinquish the pleasure of torturing him. Her own
heart was so little touched that she could have no pity for his
troubles; indeed, it seemed somewhat to appease the few reproaches which
haunted her, in spite of her vanity and selfishness, to occasion him
uneasiness and pain.</p>

<p>"When I come a second time you will put me off with some new pretext,"
he said, angrily.</p>

<p>"Then you cannot take my word? Very well; if you will not believe me,
what can I do?"</p>

<p>"I have never doubted you, Ellen."</p>

<p>"Indeed you have had no reason to think about it either way," she
replied, carelessly; "we were nothing to each other more than common
acquaintances."</p>

<p>"You know that I have loved you for years&mdash;that I have given up my home,
my profession&mdash;have endured and suffered every thing on your account."</p>

<p>"I would not give much for affection which would be unwilling to do that
much," she retorted.</p>

<p>"I was willing," he said; "but at least now, let there be an end to all
this&mdash;tell me when you will become my wife?"</p>

<p>"When I am accomplished enough to set up for a lady."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
"That you were always."</p>

<p>"<i>He</i> used to call me so," she replied, with a shade of sadness.</p>

<p>Thrasher turned pale.</p>

<p>"Don't speak of him in my presence, Ellen; it is cruel."</p>

<p>"To his memory, yes," she answered, with real bitterness in her voice.</p>

<p>Thrasher sat down irritated and pale. "Ellen," he said, "it would be far
better if you would consent to take a voyage and be married at once in
France or Italy. I am restless in this country&mdash;it is hard to breathe
the same air with one's parents&mdash;and such parents, Ellen, without
sometimes wishing to see them."</p>

<p>"I thought you wished to give them up as I was willing to put away all
the friends who had been kind to me," answered the heartless woman. "How
else could you or I hope to enjoy our new life? Besides, it was your own
proposal; I never asked you to sacrifice the old folks&mdash;merely said
something of how much out of place they might be, and how provoking
their ways would become in a house like that we were building in the
clouds."</p>

<p>"In reality, Ellen, the house I talked of shall be nothing to the palace
I am building for my queen."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mason's eyes flashed triumphantly.</p>

<p>"I am half tempted," she said.</p>

<p>"Ah, my love, be wholly tempted!" he pleaded, with genuine tenderness in
his voice. "No woman ever was worshipped as you shall be."</p>

<p>"Ah, but one gets tired of worship."</p>

<p>"No queen upon her throne shall have more admirers."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
"But you'll be jealous as a Turk. I am sure of that."</p>

<p>"Try me, but do not put me off in this cruel fashion."</p>

<p>"Well, Thrasher," she said, seriously enough, "get every thing ready,
and I'll take the time into consideration; but one thing is positive, we
must be married here, in this country, in this State of Connecticut. I
will have no question or mistake about that. The laws of other States,
and particularly of other countries, may be different, but I know what
they are here."</p>

<p>"I would rather be married abroad, Ellen," was the agitated reply, "for
many reasons."</p>

<p>"But I will be married in the State of Connecticut, or not at all."</p>

<p>Thrasher bent his head, and the woman saw, with astonishment, that all
the color left his face. It scarcely excited her suspicion, but the
wanton cruelty of her nature came back, and she gave a little, mocking
laugh.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are afraid that our pretty Katy may hear of it, and put in
a protest?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean, woman?" cried Thrasher, starting to his feet.</p>

<p>The widow drew herself up in magnificent displeasure.</p>

<p>"Woman, indeed."</p>

<p>Thrasher sat down, with his eyes fixed keenly on her.</p>

<p>"What did you mean, Ellen?" he said, more quietly.</p>

<p>"What did I mean? When you can look and talk like a gentleman, perhaps I
may admit that there was no meaning at all in what I said, only that
girl was dead in love with you, Thrasher, or I don't know what love is."</p>

<p>"We will let her alone, if you please," he answered, with a manner that
checked her flippancy. "The poor girl is nothing to us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
"I should hope not," replied the widow, with a disdainful motion of her
head. "In my poorest days I was always above that sort of people; and
remember, Thrasher, when we are married&mdash;if I ever could make up my mind
to it, you know&mdash;these old neighbors must be kept at a distance."</p>

<p>"Have I not promised? Is it not decided that we go by my Christian name
after that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember something was said about it. A good idea. That will be
cutting them off root and branch, old folks and all; besides, Mrs.
Nelson has a refined sound."</p>

<p>Thrasher sighed heavily.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "we shall be alone in the world then, you and I."</p>

<p>"But we shall go out of our old world and find a new one," she answered,
proudly. "Millionaires are never alone."</p>

<p>"How worldly you are getting! But it becomes you."</p>

<p>"Worldly? No, only wise! But we are staying here a long time; Mrs. Prior
will wonder what it is all for, and Rose will cry her eyes out, poor
thing."</p>

<p>"You wish me to go?" he said, in a mortified tone.</p>

<p>"Why, yes; one must not risk a good name among strangers. It is
something a little unusual for me to receive gentlemen."</p>

<p>"I am glad of that, Ellen."</p>

<p>"Oh, I have no desire for visitors of either sex."</p>

<p>"But when may I come for good? I must know that."</p>

<p>"Well, I cannot tell the exact time, but it shall be within a few
months; weeks, perhaps, if you are good."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
"Then it shall be. You promise that?" he said, kindling with delight.</p>

<p>"Yes, Thrasher, I promise now. Only give me time," and she held out her
hand, he kissed it, and went away.</p>

<br />
<span class="sub">A DOUBLE GUARD.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was true the officer had insisted that Katharine should be removed to
one of the upper chambers. She was gradually recovering strength, and
though he had not the heart to propose her removal to prison, the
dangers of escape became more apparent each hour. At last he suggested
the only means of safety that presented itself&mdash;Katharine must be
confined in the upper story, from whence flight would be difficult,
unless assistance should come from without, a thing that he considered
more than improbable.</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen made no resistance to these arrangements, for well the poor
mother knew that all protest would be in vain. In some respects she
preferred the change. It would remove Katharine from the sight of her
jailor whenever the door of her room was opened; a presence that had
become unspeakably oppressive of late. She seemed afraid of
understanding what it meant, but every time his face passed by, or his
shadow appeared on the wall, a terror came into her eyes, and she would
look wistfully out, as you have seen a poor little rabbit peering with
his great brown eyes through the trap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span> some cruel boy had baited for him
when the snow covered all other food.</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen had seen this with an aching heart. The man who usurped her
own high-backed chair, with his feet stretched out stolidly on the
hearth, watching the door of her child's room, had become a torment to
her, patient and undemonstrative as she was. So the room was prepared,
and in gentle silence Katharine took possession of it. She had no
courage to question her mother, but shrunk with sensitive pain from the
truth, harassed with fears, yet dreading to have them confirmed.</p>

<p>The mother, too, shrunk from the subject, which was forever lying cold
at her heart. What good would it do were she to place all the hideous
danger before her child? The law would strike hard enough when its time
came; she had no heart to help it by a word.</p>

<p>They were very silent together, those two wretched women, for&mdash;with the
one subject that filled their existence held in abeyance&mdash;what could
they talk about? But the mother grew so gentle, so exquisitely loving,
that some gleams of joy broke through their misery; still, the
tenderness of this affection almost broke her child's heart. It was the
offshoot of a great sorrow, which had softened the stern character of
the mother, and lifted the young girl into sudden womanhood. The hour of
maternity, be it in joy or grief, breaks down all the barriers of age,
and, as in this case, the extremes of womanhood meet with some degree of
equality.</p>

<p>But a painful apprehension was always at Katharine's heart. No one told
her the terrible fate of which that man, sitting forever on her mother's
hearth, was the harbinger, but
<a name="the2" id="the2"></a><ins title="Original has duplicated the">the</ins> truth pressed
vaguely upon her understanding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span> and her solitude was a perpetual
terror. She grew keen in her observation. She searched even the mournful
eyes of little Paul and the grieved features of Jube, in her silent
quest after the knowledge she had no courage to claim in words.</p>

<p>Now two men kept guard in the room below. Their prisoner was getting
strong, and more vigilance became advisable.</p>

<p>The night that this double guard was set upon her, Katharine could not
sleep, for the two men conversed in low voices that penetrated to her
chamber, and tortured every nerve in her body. What evil things were
they saying in those muffled tones? Perhaps talking about her babe? What
would they do with her in the end?</p>

<p>Dark ideas of the terrible truth came slowly over her. She was seized
with an uncontrollable wish to hear what it was that kept her jailors in
such close conversation.</p>

<p>Shivering with dread, yet filled with a sort of wild courage, she arose
and crept from her room down-stairs. A door opened from the stairway
into the kitchen&mdash;it was left slightly ajar&mdash;and through the crevice
came a gleam of light from a candle that stood on the mantlepiece.
Katharine sunk down on the lowest step and listened keenly.</p>

<p>"Yes," said one of the men, "it's a settled thing&mdash;they'll take her off
in the morning. Tough, though, aint it."</p>

<p>"Does the old woman know it?"</p>

<p>"I reckon not; the constable says he can't find the heart to tell her
till the last minute."</p>

<p>"What will they do with her in the end? Have you any idea?"</p>

<p>"Well, law's law, you know, and I calculate they'll hang the poor
critter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
"No!"</p>

<p>"Sartin; the constable was saying so at the hill store only yesterday.
The strangling," says he, "might a been got over; but that burying of
the poor little critter in the snow was the pint that no lawyer could
ixplain."</p>

<p>"Yes; that allus stops a feller's mouth when he sets out to defend her,
and yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What was you a saying?"</p>

<p>"And yet I can't bleave she really did it."</p>

<p>"It's unnatural; but facts are facts."</p>

<p>"Poor critter; I wonder if she's told any thing about its father yet.
The feller ought to be hung fifty times where she had once."</p>

<p>"I reckon not; the old woman said that her daughter was married, at the
examination, but she would not name the man, and people were left to
guess."</p>

<p>"Was it Nelson Thrasher, do you really think?"</p>

<p>"There's no telling, and maybe it wont come out till court day."</p>

<p>"And when it does, what'll the law do with him?"</p>

<p>"Well, I aint quite sure; but suppose it would be brought in preup terus
criminus; that is, 'complice 'fore the act."</p>

<p>"You don't say so. Then it'll be a hanging matter for him, too?"</p>

<p>"Sure as Sunday."</p>

<p>"But how will they find him? Maybe, Katharine wont inform."</p>

<p>"Oh, she'll tell; women always do."</p>

<p>The poor young mother behind the door was quaking with fear, and chilled
through and through with the cold. Her teeth chattered so loudly that
she lost the next few words; but those that followed were horrible
enough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
"Did you ever see a person hung?"</p>

<p>"Yes; once."</p>

<p>"Wall!"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me about it; the rope broke, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hark! wasn't that a voice?"</p>

<p>"No; it's one of the icicles falling from the eaves."</p>

<p>"It seemed to come from the stairs, I thought; suppose we look."</p>

<p>"Oh, be still. It's the ice, I tell you. Just hand me a drink of that
ginger cider. This talk about hanging makes the cold chills run over
me."</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence, then a deep, satisfied breath, and the
jingle of a pewter mug as it was set down between the andirons.</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="xxxix" id="xxxix"></a>CHAPTER XXXIX.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">OUT IN THE DEPTHS OF THE NIGHT.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">How</span> she got to her room, Katharine never knew; but little Paul sat with
his back to the door which led from her chamber to his, and heard faint
shudderings with that icy sound which had disturbed the men, for a long
time after she entered the room. It troubled him so much at last that he
went into the outer garret and sought Jube, who stood like a bronze
statue by a window in the gable.</p>

<p>"Jube, I'm sure that she is up now, you can hear her tremble through the
door."</p>

<p>Jube put a finger to his lip, and lifting Paul in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span> arms, pointed
through the window. The end of a ladder rested against the sill, and Tom
sat perched on one of the upper rounds, motioning to Jube that he must
stoop down and help him in.</p>

<p>The moment after he stood in a broad space of moonlight that paved the
garret, whispering eagerly:</p>

<p>"I've come before the time, I have, and hain't got a sign of a wagon nor
sleigh; for, consarn him, par locked the stable door to-night, the first
time he ever did it in his life, I'm a'most sartin. But it's got to be
done. Them constables will be arter her to-morrow, sartin. We'll get her
out somehow this very night, and trust to luck arterward."</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" inquired Paul, full of generous courage. "Jube has
got the gold."</p>

<p>"That's half," answered Tom, promptly. "Now, Paul, you go into the room
and tell her to get right up and huddle on all the furs, and cloaks, and
things that she's got, and tell her to be still as twenty mice. Them
chaps below are as wide awake as nighthawks. I've been watching 'em
through the winder since twelve o'clock; but they've just begun to pitch
into the hot ginger and cider, and that'll put 'em to sleep, sure."</p>

<p>"But if she wont come?" said Paul.</p>

<p>"Wont? she must, or stay here and be&mdash;&mdash;oh, I can't bear to think of it.
Now get along, Paul, and do as I tell you."</p>

<p>Paul went softly into Katharine's room. She was sitting on the bed in
her long nightgown, cold and still, frozen, as it were, in the
moonlight, which fell over her from a near window.</p>

<p>Paul shrunk back at first, her face looked so deathly; but he found
courage, and took the cold hands that lay clasped on her lap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
What he said in those low, eager whispers, the boy himself scarcely
knew; but after the first words she bent down, listening greedily.
Friends in the outer room, a ladder at the window, money to take her
from that guarded house, life, liberty, away from the terrible shadow of
those men, clear from that gaunt horror which they talked about so
calmly. Yes, she would go. Life was very sweet, and she so young. Out to
sea in a vessel bound for a long voyage. Thus, she would in time meet
her husband, whose name her silence had saved from disgrace. She began
to love herself for this thought, and, gathering fresh energy, put on
her outer garments.</p>

<p>Paul went into the garret and told his friends that Katharine was
getting ready. His voice was raised imprudently, it penetrated to a room
at the other end of the garret, and might have disturbed the guards, but
their deep potations at the warm cider had, as Tom predicted, thrown
them into a sound sleep.</p>

<p>All this while Mrs. Allen had been lying in the back of her daughter's
bed with her face to the wall. The wearing effect of nights without
sleep and days of harassing labor lay heavily upon her. At most times
she was a sound sleeper, but now it seemed as if death itself had taken
possession of her faculties. She knew nothing of Katharine's absence
from the room&mdash;nothing of Paul's entrance, but the first cold touch of
the fugitive's hand was enough. The gray eyes opened wildly in the
moonlight, and she started up in bed.</p>

<p>Katharine stood before her fully dressed, and with some heavy dark
garment in her hand. Mrs. Allen heard Paul speaking in the garret
outside, and comprehended the scene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
"Mother, I am going. They want to kill me; I am innocent, and have a
right to my life. I am going away, mother."</p>

<p>The whispers in which Katharine spoke were broken, and came gasping from
her lips. Mrs. Allen started from the bed and began to put on her
clothes.</p>

<p>"Yes," she muttered, wildly, "I have thought of this night and day. One
does not see a lamb go to the slaughter without a wish to help it. The
child of one's old age is better than a lamb. I said to myself, if the
instincts of innocence lead her to it, she shall escape. She has
forfeited nothing&mdash;her life is her own&mdash;God gave it to her, and God will
instruct her how to keep it."</p>

<p>Tom opened the door, and came into the room on tiptoe.</p>

<p>"Hush! don't, Mrs. Allen. We can hear you a muttering clear into the
garret. Them men down-stairs love cider, but they ain't moles. Just give
'em a chance, and they'll be after us full split afore you know
it&mdash;hish!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen did not speak again, but took a heavy cloak from the wall and
folded it over the garments which she had just put on. She took
Katharine's hand in her own firm grasp, and led her into the garret. The
gable window was open, and a cold, sharp wind came sweeping through,
while the moonlight thus let in fell half across the garret.</p>

<p>Jube was on the ladder outside, waiting. Paul stood aside from the
light, but the eager fire of his eyes could be seen even in the
darkness. The mother and child were half way across the garret, when
Katharine broke away suddenly, and went back, her face uplifted, as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
she were counting the rafters. She disappeared in the gloom, and her
hand made a creaking noise, as it passed along the torn shingles
projecting themselves from one of the rafters. But she darted back into
the moonlight with a scrap of paper in her hand, which rustled to the
wind like a dead leaf.</p>

<p>"I am ready now, mother," she whispered.</p>

<p>"Hist! he! he!"</p>

<p>It was like the lowest hiss of a serpent, the sound with which Tom
warned his allies, and signified that all was ready.</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen lifted her daughter in both arms, held her one moment in a
clinging embrace, then passed her through the window, and leaned out
till Jube stood with her at the foot of the ladder. After that, she
followed, while Paul and Tom crept after, noiselessly as shadows.</p>

<p>"Come this way," said Tom. "It's a glare of ice all around, but I
scattered ashes along here, so keep straight ahead, while I take a peep,
and see if them old chaps are sleeping yet."</p>

<p>The little group drew close together, and moved quickly along the path
which Tom had made safe with wood ashes. Directly that youngster joined
them, chuckling to himself, and rubbing his yarn mittens gleefully
together.</p>

<p>"They're in for it! Oh, Miss Allen, that cider of your'n must be
scrumptious stuff. They've drunk up the hull bilin of it, and there the
great pewter mug lies atween 'em, upsot on the harth, a little gingery
stream a running and a hissing from it into the fire. There they set,
each of 'em, with his legs half way across the harth, and the toes of
his boot a sticking up, sliding off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span> from them chairs till their boots
eenamost touch, and each on 'em has got his head pitched forward and his
face hid in his bosom, and snoring like all nature. Oh, Paul, I'd a gin
the world to have boo-hood right out as loud as I wanted to."</p>

<p>All this was said in a loud whisper that sounded sharp and distinct on
the frosty air, but no one heeded it. The two women hurried forward in
dead silence; Paul and Jube went before, making a path, for they had
turned into the field, and had instinctively crept within the shadow of
the stone wall which Katharine had fled along on that fearful day. They
were fast approaching the old butternut tree, when Katharine, whose
breath had come quick and short with each step, reeled and fell back
against the wall.</p>

<p>"I can't go this road," she gasped, pointing to the butternut tree,
which flung its gaunt skeleton shadow far out on the snow. "Take me any
road but this."</p>

<p>Tom, who had been running along in the moonlight, came up, speaking for
the first time in his full voice.</p>

<p>"That's right; we may as well stop and make up our minds what to do
next, as Robinson Crusoe did when he reached that ere uninhabited
island; for the old soger warn't much wuss off than we are, I reckon,
'specially now that we've got another woman 'tached onto the consarn."</p>

<p>"She's ill, the poor mademoiselle," whispered Paul.</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;we havn't time for that ere; tell her she mustn't think of it."</p>

<p>"Mother," whispered Katharine, "take me away! It seems as if my ghost
had been here before."</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen drew close to her child and tried to shelter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span> her alike from
the cold and a sight of that gaunt old tree.</p>

<p>"What shall we do next?" inquired Tom, feeling the want of some
efficient counsellor. "Miss Allen, as you've kinder broke into this ere
concern without asking, I give up being leader, 'specially not knowing
what on 'arth to do. I've sot her free, and that's glory enough for one
little feller, so now I throw up and consign."</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen gathered Katharine closer in her arms, and looking in the
boy's face, strove to comprehend the position in which they were placed.</p>

<p>"Tell me what it was you hoped to do for my daughter," she said, gently.
"I know nothing more than that she was ready to escape, and I followed.
The idea was in my dreams, and we are here. Was there any place you had
in view where she could be safe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, marm, there was," answered Tom. "Jube and Paul can tell you all
about it. We got it up together, us three. I meant to have brought par's
hoss and wagon, but the old man locked 'em up. Besides, we did not mean
to go into it till to-morrow night, only the constable let out as he'd
take her off in the morning, so we had to come right up to the rack,
ready or not; and now we are free and independent. But where to go? that
ere is the question."</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen uttered a low groan; the frail form in her arms grew heavier
and heavier. The desperate course they had taken presented itself to her
mind in all its hopelessness.</p>

<p>"Oh, my God, must I take her back?" she moaned, lifting her face to
heaven.</p>

<p>"Has madame no friends&mdash;no house where mademoiselle could hide one
little day?" said Paul. "Jube<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span> has gold, great deal of gold, that people
in this country like very much. People that have much gold can run
away&mdash;Tom says that&mdash;oh, very far. We will take mademoiselle to Monsieur
Rice; he very strong, like Jube; nobody touch him&mdash;never dare."</p>

<p>"Yes, marm," struck in Tom. "The sloop which goes out of New Haven twice
a week, sails Saturday. Jube's got lots and lots of chink. Just send him
to Dave Rice; he's the fellow to tell the constable what's what&mdash;he is."</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen gathered in the whole plot, and her clear judgment saw at
once that it was the only means of escape left for her child. The
attempt, which had seemed a moment before so rash, took consistency and
wisdom in her mind. God himself seemed to have provided the means of
escape for her child.</p>

<p>"Well, now, what do you think it's best to do?" asked Tom, flattered by
her grave attention. "You are the gineral now; I'm only a soger."</p>

<p>"May the God of heaven bless you, my brave boy," said the mother, with
deep feeling.</p>

<p>Tom hastily wiped the cuff of his jacket across his eyes.</p>

<p>"Don't, Miss Allen; don't say that ere; 'cause, you know, I was kinder
diserbaying my parents, and I'm afeared he'll remember to set one agin
t'other, and I might git the worst of it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen looked around along the dreary road.</p>

<p>"Is there no one of all our neighbors who would shelter us for one
night?" she cried.</p>

<p>"Mother," said Katharine, struggling from her arms and trying to stand
up, "<i>his</i> father. I will go to him. It was his wish. I will go to his
home. Where else should a wife ask shelter?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Mrs. Allen drew a heavy breath.</p>

<p>"Come, mother, come."</p>

<p>"Where is it you have an idea of going?" inquired Tom, forgetting that
he had resigned all command of the party, and was only a "soger."</p>

<p>"Up yonder," answered Mrs. Allen; "we will ask them to hide us for one
night, in the barn, or anywhere."</p>

<p>"Us? you say us?" persisted Tom, shaking his head. "Now I'm only a
soger, you know, Mrs. Allen, but if I had the lead yet, I'd jest observe
that one is easier hid than two. If them fellers get up, and find the
house empty, they'll search like blazes, and the fust thing after
daylight; but if you're there to get 'em a warm breakfast, and Jube's on
hand to pile on the wood, they'd kinder be content, and not ask about
anybody else mebby till noon."</p>

<p>"You are right," said the mother. "Let me know that she is safe and I
will go home again. My child, can you walk?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother."</p>

<p>"No, no; she trembles. Let Jube carry her&mdash;he is so strong," said Paul.</p>

<p>Jube came forward with his brawny arms extended. Mrs. Allen gave up her
child, and she was carried away so swiftly that the boys were compelled
to run in order to keep up with the negro, but Mrs. Allen walked close
to him, never faltering or pausing to draw breath till the whole group
stood in front of Mr. Thrasher's house.</p>

<p>Jube sat Katharine quietly down upon the snow, where she stood gazing
wistfully toward the house, till her mother reminded her that there was
no time to spare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
"Leave me," said the poor creature, "leave me here, mother. I would
rather go in alone&mdash;quite alone&mdash;it will be easier."</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen hesitated, but Tom came up with one of his clinching
arguments.</p>

<p>"It's nigh on to morning, Mrs. Allen, and we are only doing her hurt. If
she goes in alone they wont have the heart to send her off, but if we
all stand here ready to go farther, they'd tell us to keep on just as
like as not."</p>

<p>"He is right, mother," said Katharine, faintly. "Give me one kiss&mdash;God
will help me&mdash;have no fear."</p>

<p>The old woman pressed her cold lips to that still colder face, and went
away, looking mournfully behind, from time to time, until a bend of the
road took her out of sight.</p>

<h2><a name="xl" id="xl"></a>CHAPTER XL.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">TAKEN IN FROM THE COLD.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> old couple were in bed, but not sleeping. Since the return of their
son, weary, broken nights and most anxious days had marked the lives of
these blameless people. It had been very hard to part with their son
when he almost seemed domesticated with them. It had been hard to expect
him back, day after day, and always with keen disappointment following
the morning's hope. But more bitter than all was the news that had
reached them within the last few days. Nelson had sailed again&mdash;sailed
on a long voyage into those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span> seas which take the youth out of a man
before he returns.</p>

<p>How could they help being wakeful? Were they not worse than childless?
Of the grave they knew something&mdash;its length, its depth, and how long it
required for the green turf to spring up and draw the uncouth mound back
into the loving bosom of nature. But what did they know of those far off
waters where ships were lost in immensity, and fishes of monstrous size
tempted men away from their homes. A whaling voyage&mdash;that was like a
life banishment to an old couple who had so many gray hairs on their
temples.</p>

<p>They could not sleep, though each kind heart strove to cheat the
other&mdash;both were wakeful and miserably anxious.</p>

<p>"Father?"</p>

<p>The old man would not speak, but drew a long, heavy breath, which
smothered a sigh, while it was intended to deceive the good soul into a
belief of his sound slumber.</p>

<p>"Father, I say?"</p>

<p>Still he would not answer, for the poor mother had got a habit of
keeping herself awake with midnight conversations in these days, and he
was determined to put it down with masterly inactivity.</p>

<p>"Dear old man, I'm glad he can sleep so sound," she murmured, rising
softly to her elbow and putting the gray locks back from his forehead,
which she kissed with infinite tenderness. "It's a shame to wake him
up."</p>

<p>The old man turned softly, and said with inward contrition, "I am awake,
wife."</p>

<p>"Father, I think there's some one knocking at the window."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
The old man lifted his head, and listened.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Thrasher! oh, Mrs. Thrasher, wont you let me in?"</p>

<p>There was a moan of anguish in the words that struck to the heart at
once. The old man held his breath, while the wife clung to him with her
head lifted from the pillow.</p>

<p>"It's her, it's Katy Allen," she whispered.</p>

<p>The old man slipped out of bed and hurried on his clothes. She, good
soul, followed him, groping for her dress in the dark, but another faint
knock on the glass, and a mournful voice crying, "Wont you let me in?
I'm freezing! I'm freezing," sent her to the window in nothing but her
long night gown and cap, with its double borders shading a very pale and
startled face.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thrasher lifted the sash and looked out. A dark figure sat
crouching on the snow where it had just fallen after losing its hold on
the window sill.</p>

<p>"Katharine, Katharine Allen, is it you?"</p>

<p>The figure struggled to its feet, and clinging to the window-frame with
one hand, put the other through the opening, where it touched Mrs.
Thrasher on the bosom. A lump of snow could not have chilled her more
completely, but nothing cold had power to reach that kind heart. She
lifted her plump little hands and folded the trembling fingers to her
bosom tenderly as if some stray bird had fluttered there. Then the sharp
wind swept over them both, and dropping the hand with a caress, the
woman said, kindly:</p>

<p>"Go round to the door, Katharine. Father is unbolting it now."</p>

<p>Katharine turned away. Mrs. Thrasher closed the window, and hurrying on
a garment or two, went into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span> the next room, where the embers of a noble
hickory wood fire lay smouldering under a bed of ashes. While she was
raking out the fire Mr. Thrasher came in, treading softly in his
stocking feet, and with the suspenders he had forgotten to button,
trailing to the floor behind him. From the darkness beyond came
Katharine Allen; her hood was pushed back, and sparkles of ice shone in
her hair as the ruddy light from two brands thrown hastily together
flashed over her. She had been crying, but the tears had frozen to
pearls on her cheeks, and filled her eyelashes with delicate frostiness.</p>

<p>She entered the room and sat down in Mrs. Thrasher's chair, looking
wistfully at the old woman, and begging pardon with her eyes as she
touched the blue and red patchwork cushion, which, in those days, was
sacred to the mistress of a New England home.</p>

<p>"I am very cold," she said, with a wan smile; "it chilled me through
standing by the gate so long."</p>

<p>"Poor child," said Mrs. Thrasher, gathering the stray brands together
with a pair of heavy tongs. "Father, just hand in a stick or two of wood
from the entry way. There, now, set up close to the andirons. Never mind
us, we're not a-cold."</p>

<p>Katharine drew close to the fire, and held out her hands, that trembled
and fluttered to the heat like half perished birds.</p>

<p>"I ran away," she said, piteously; "crept out of the garret window, and
came off here. They want to kill me, you know."</p>

<p>The old people looked at each other and turned away, with their faces in
shadow.</p>

<p>"You'll not be afraid to hide me a little while?" she questioned,
anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
The old lady bent over her, with tears in her soft eyes.</p>

<p>"Afraid, dear? no; we're not afraid, are we, father?" she said,
lovingly.</p>

<p>A noise outside startled Katharine; she sprang up and fixed her wild
eyes on the window.</p>

<p>"They've seen the light&mdash;they're after me."</p>

<p>"It's only an icicle dropping from the eaves," said the old lady,
smiling. "There isn't a soul near but father and I, Katharine, dear, and
you aint going to be afraid of us?"</p>

<p>Katharine looked at her lingeringly and sat down again.</p>

<p>"No; I'm not afraid of you. He told me to come, and not fear any thing."</p>

<p>Mrs. Thrasher drew close to the girl and bent over her.</p>

<p>"He, dear; tell us, father and I, you know, who it is you mean by <i>he</i>?"</p>

<p>Katharine looked up, and a strange light came to her face; it was as if
a pearl had been suddenly illuminated at the heart.</p>

<p>"It was Nelson who told me to come," she said, in a tender voice.</p>

<p>"Nelson Thrasher&mdash;our son?" interposed the old man, almost sternly.</p>

<p>Katharine shrank together in her chair, and looked at him with a
frightened glance.</p>

<p>"Did I say Nelson?" she questioned, faintly. "Not if it makes you angry
with him."</p>

<p>The old man rose from his chair, and stood up in the fire light.</p>

<p>"Katharine," he said, "tell us the truth&mdash;was it our son who brought
this shame and trouble on you?"</p>

<p>The words were stern. The old man trembled in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span> his limbs, but still
there was strength both in his look and utterance.</p>

<p>"Shame, no; it is not shame for him&mdash;you might be sure of me there," she
said, with pathetic simplicity. "I never mentioned him, and never will.
So don't speak of shame and Nelson in one breath. The disgrace is mine,
you know; and the sorrow, he shall never hear of it&mdash;never."</p>

<p>The old lady looked imploringly at her husband, and shrank back into the
shadows of the room, wringing her hands.</p>

<p>"And this is my son! He brings ruin on an innocent, thoughtless girl,
and then abandons her for years&mdash;her and his parents."</p>

<p>"Ruin! No, not that!" cried Katharine. "Shame! No! no! It is I that
somehow have brought disgrace on him! Only I never told his name&mdash;never
will ask for it! Don't be afraid. I didn't come for that&mdash;only to beg a
hiding-place for one day. Those men will never know that I have any
right to come here. Let them search. If they tear the house down,
nothing will be found under the rafters. I've got the paper here!"</p>

<br />
<span class="sub">THE MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">She</span> pressed one hand to her bosom, and smiled proudly, as if they ought
to be grateful for something she had done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
"The paper&mdash;what paper?" questioned Mrs. Thrasher.</p>

<p>"That which the minister gave us. It is more than three months, and he
told me not to wait longer than that."</p>

<p>"Let me read the paper, girl!"</p>

<p>"Yes," joined in Mrs. Thrasher, coming out of her obscurity. "Let father
read the paper."</p>

<p>"He told me to bring it here after three months," said Katharine,
looking at them doubtfully; "but he did not know how it would happen.
Dreadful things have been done that he never thought of, so I must be
careful. I am only a poor girl, and they have almost done the worst by
me. Nothing can disgrace me more, but it hasn't reached him yet. I
wouldn't even tell the doctor. Nobody ever saw the paper. That is my
secret&mdash;the only thing I have left. When they have killed me I will eat
the paper, and die with it in my bosom, be sure of that."</p>

<p>"But you will tell us&mdash;remember he is our only child, and it is hard not
to know the truth&mdash;hard to think badly of him," pleaded the mother.</p>

<p>"Badly of him&mdash;who has a right to do that?" said Katharine, excitedly.
"You ought to know better. But you are only his mother, not his&mdash;"</p>

<p>"His what, dear?"</p>

<p>Katharine shook her head, and bent her eyes on the fire.</p>

<p>"If you have a paper that belongs to my son, let me read it, girl. I
have a right," pursued the old man.</p>

<p>"Right&mdash;when you can think badly of him? I never could do that; but he
told me to come here and ask shelter, not knowing how much I should need
it. I want to obey him&mdash;want to make you think well of him&mdash;but how can
I do it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
"Give us the paper if that will tell us the truth about our son,"
answered the old man, firmly.</p>

<p>"But you might use it to disgrace his name."</p>

<p>"We are his parents, girl."</p>

<p>"But you suspect him, what of?"</p>

<p>"Of wronging you&mdash;we have suspected him of this!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Katharine, father couldn't help it, you know. It broke his heart,
but he&mdash;that is, we couldn't clear Nelson in our minds. If you can only
help us, dear!"</p>

<p>Katharine bent toward the fire, clasping both hands around her knees,
and muttering to herself, "It would be worse than death to think ill of
him. They have a right."</p>

<p>She drew back slowly, and turned to the old man.</p>

<p>"Promise me something, Mr. Thrasher."</p>

<p>"I will promise any thing that will be for your good."</p>

<p>"Promise never to let any human being know what is in this paper, and
I'll show it to you."</p>

<p>"We are his parents, and are not likely to tell any thing that would
disgrace our son."</p>

<p>"Promise her, father; no matter what it is, promise!" pleaded the
mother, creeping round to her husband's side.</p>

<p>The old man hesitated. Katharine bent slowly toward the fire again.</p>

<p>"Promise," whispered the mother. "If our son is wrong, we shall never
have the heart to speak of it. If he is innocent, no one but his own
parents have had the cruelty to suspect him."</p>

<p>"I never thought wrong of him, never in my life," murmured Katharine,
gazing into the fire; "that would kill me before those dark men had a
chance."</p>

<p>"Well, girl, what promise shall I make?" questioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span> the old man, who
had been listening to his wife with serious attention.</p>

<p>"Only that you will never mention the paper, nor what I tell you, till
Nelson comes back."</p>

<p>"Well, I promise that."</p>

<p>"Yes; we promise," repeated the mother.</p>

<p>Katharine took a scrap of paper from her bosom, unfolded it with a
loving touch, and gave it to the old man. There was no candle in the
room, but his spectacles lay on the closed Bible, where he had left them
on going to bed. He put them on, and knelt down by the fire, from which
his wife forced a shower of sparks with the tongs. As the old man read
the paper, she bent over him, and when his head fell forward and buried
itself in his hands, her sobs mingled with the broken thanks that sprang
from the father's heart.</p>

<p>At last he arose to his feet, and looked at his wife, who crept into his
arms, and laying her withered cheek on his bosom, whispered:</p>

<p>"Remember, husband, I told you so. Told you from the first, either that
it was not true, or that she was our daughter."</p>

<p>As the sweet words fell from her lips, the good woman looked on the girl
with a countenance so heavenly, that Katharine smiled under it, and for
a moment forgot what a wretched fugitive she was.</p>

<p>"Now," said the old man, seating himself, and stooping toward their
midnight guest; "now that our son is cleared from this great guilt, tell
us&mdash;for remember you are our child&mdash;tell us about this terrible thing
they accuse you of."</p>

<p>Katharine turned cold and white, then she lifted her sweet young face,
and with her eyes turned clearly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span> his, told him all that she knew,
word for word, feeling for feeling; and from the depths of her true
heart he saw how innocent she was.</p>

<p>The old woman listened with him, but her gentle heart gave way long
before Katharine had done her story; when it was finished she gathered
the poor girl in her arms and wept over her.</p>

<p>"What can we do? How help her?" she said, addressing the old man. "The
law is like a hound&mdash;it will take her anywhere; and she is our
child&mdash;our innocent, innocent daughter."</p>

<p>Katharine clung to the woman, as she uttered these words, and began to
cry. It was sweet to be so trusted and cared for in the midst of her
desolation.</p>

<p>"Where can we put her? What can we do, father?"</p>

<p>There was no answer&mdash;the old man sat looking at her very sadly and with
deep thoughtfulness.</p>

<p>"Let us first ask what the good God intends in all this. He does not
lead the young into peril, or the innocent into shame for nothing. It is
a fearful risk, but let us do right."</p>

<p>Katharine looked on him in affright, her eyes growing wildly large, her
lips falling apart, till the white teeth shone through.</p>

<p>"You will not give me up? They will kill me! Oh, father, they will kill
me!"</p>

<p>She had called him father for the first time in her life, and the word
came forth in a cry of anguish that made even his strong heart shrink.</p>

<p>"No," he said, gently. "Not for all the gold of Ophir would I do this
thing."</p>

<p>Katharine drew a long breath. The old woman folded her in a closer
embrace, and softly whispered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
That she must have no fear&mdash;God always guarded the innocent.</p>

<p>And so they rested a little while in silence. The old man buried in
thought. The women watching him with anxious faces.</p>

<p>"I will take her to <i>his</i> chamber," said the mother, at last, "the
blinds are down and we can find the way without light."</p>

<p>Mr. Thrasher said nothing, but regarded the fugitive in grave sadness.</p>

<p>"Stay with her till morning," he said; "she has left her mother behind,
poor woman."</p>

<p>Katharine arose and went up to the old man.</p>

<p>"You are his father and believe me," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, Katharine, I believe you&mdash;I will give all that I have to prove how
innocent you are&mdash;I will mortgage the farm to-morrow, if that will do."</p>

<p>"Only tell me where I can find him. He will not let any one harm me; you
know that."</p>

<p>"If we knew&mdash;if we only knew; but the sea is a broad desert of waters,
where no man finds his fellow for seeking."</p>

<p>"Has Nelson gone to sea?" faltered the poor girl.</p>

<p>"Yes, Katharine, on a long voyage. He may not come back for years."</p>

<p>She stood still, dumb with pain, and thrills of awe ran through her
voice when it struggled back to her.</p>

<p>"Who told me of this before?"</p>

<p>"No one, my child; it came in a letter, and we never mentioned a word of
it to a living soul."</p>

<p>"A letter to you and none to me; but who told me, I say? or when did I
dream something like it? I wish all this was clear. Nelson writes to
you, and yet I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span> beforehand what news the letter brings. It has kept
me awake nights, but in the daytime fell back into dreams again."</p>

<p>She stood a moment with one hand to her forehead, then dropped it, and
said, quickly:</p>

<p>"Let me read his letter, may I?"</p>

<p>The old man opened the great Bible, and took the letter from between its
leaves. She knelt down upon the hearth and read it through.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "it is true. He has gone. I might search the world over
and never find him. They might kill me, and my husband never hear of it.
This is worse than their threats, worse than death, for it shuts out all
hope. Where could I go? The world is so wide, and I have not learned the
way anywhere."</p>

<p>"Oh, if you could but stay with us till he comes!" exclaimed the old
lady.</p>

<p>"But they will not let me. To-morrow, perhaps, those men will come here
and force you to give me up."</p>

<p>"I never will, never on earth," cried the old woman, flushing with the
generous courage that filled her heart. "They shall tear me all to
pieces first."</p>

<p>The old man stood up. The solemn thoughtfulness had left his face, and
it was sadly calm, as if some painful doubt had left his mind. He went
up to Katharine and laid both hands on her head. She looked at him with
her sad eyes, and almost smiled, his face was so pleasant that it
reassured her.</p>

<p>"You have thought of some way by which we can find him?" she said, with
a gush of gratitude mellowing her voice.</p>

<p>"No, Katharine, that is impossible. Ships that have sailed can never be
overtaken; but have you forgotten,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span> child, that the guilty alone stand
in need of flight&mdash;God protects the innocent."</p>

<p>"Oh, he has abandoned me," sighed the poor fugitive. "Some wicked thing
has woven snares about me that look so like guilt that even he turns
away."</p>

<p>"He never turns away. By-and-by, child, his doings will be made clear.
Out of the depths of tribulation great mercies are sometimes wrought."</p>

<p>"You do not think it wise that I escaped from those men," she faltered.</p>

<p>He pressed one broad hand lovingly on her head. The touch sent a holy
shock through her frame. Some of the broad courage that filled his
Christian heart entered hers, and it flashed upon her how cowardly her
flight had been&mdash;how much like a confession of guilt it appeared.</p>

<p>"I have nowhere to go," she said, mournfully. "If I get away every one
will think it was from a sense of guilt that I left. I am his wife, your
son's wife, and must not let myself be unjustly condemned. Is that what
you mean, father?"</p>

<p>"Go to bed, child, and before you sleep ask these questions of our
Father who is in heaven. He will turn your heart aright."</p>

<p>She bent her head and clung for a moment to the hand which he had
extended; a great pain struggled at her heart; she knew what his words
portended. Like the angel who met Hagar in her extremity, he was about
to warn her back to her bonds.</p>

<p>They parted for the night, and Katharine went up to Thrasher's chamber,
led through the darkness by the gentle guidance of his mother. The
moonlight lay full in the room, and she could see all the objects it
contained&mdash;his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span> bed, the glass in which he had feared to look, and the
carpet which his boyish knees had pressed.</p>

<p>The old lady helped her undress, and after she lay down, arranged the
bed-clothes and pillows as she had a thousand times for her son.</p>

<p>"Shall I stay with you, child?" she said, at last, stooping down and
kissing her in that sweet, motherly fashion which carries protection
with it.</p>

<p>Katharine lay in her husband's bed overpowered by a strange
tranquillity. Her face looked out sweetly through the moonlight, and
both hands were folded over her bosom; she had dropped unconsciously
into an attitude of prayer.</p>

<p>"Shall I stay with you, dear child?"</p>

<p>"No, it is his room, I am not afraid; go to your own bed, mother; in the
morning I shall be strong."</p>

<p>She had called his parents father and mother more than once that
evening; there was a fascination in the words that could not be
conquered. It made the old woman's heart swell to be so addressed. Her
son's wife&mdash;it was next to having him there in person. She kissed
Katharine on the forehead, and went away through the darkness, knowing
well that a violent death hovered over that young head, but feeling
glows of happiness in her heart all the time; for, like her husband, she
believed devoutly that God protects the innocent. He does&mdash;He does, but
not always in the way His creatures are presumptuous enough to mark out
for Him.</p>

<span class="sub">ON THE FIRST STAGE TO PRISON.</span></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Well</span> now, jest tell me all about it," said Tom, hurrying little Paul
away from his playmates to a corner of the school-house where a few
gleams of sunshine gave some slight idea of warmth. "Tell me what them
chaps did when they found out what we'd been up to. Oh, golly, but I'd a
gin the last four-pence half-penny I've got to have seen 'em. Didn't
they rip and tear beautifully? Didn't they rare up and fall over
backward? Oh, yes, I kinder see 'em now staring at one another like
'stonished pigs, and wondering what cute little shaver did it. But you
don't tell me, Paul&mdash;seem kind o' down in the mouth about something."</p>

<p>"No," said Paul, gently, "my mouth isn't down, but I feel sad, very much
for the poor mademoiselle."</p>

<p>"Oh, that aint nothing; just let me get things put to rights, and she'll
be in New York and crowing over 'em all. What do you shake your head
for?"</p>

<p>"She wont go, Tom."</p>

<p>"She wont go?"</p>

<p>"No; they will kill her, but she will not run away, clear off, as we
desire."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?"</p>

<p>"I think so, sure."</p>

<p>"Oh, bother, you've got the drag on. Now jist tell me all about what
happened up yonder. How did them officer fellows act when they found out
that she was gone?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
"Oh, they found out nothing at first. Madame, that is Mrs. Allen, came
down-stairs so softly and made one good breakfast, very nice, and they
sat down, eating plenty. Madame look very white, and her hand shook when
she pour coffee into their cups, but the men very sleepy and never see
that, but sit so, with eyes almost shut and opening the mouth wide two,
three times, sleepy a good deal."</p>

<p>"Wal, I reckon it warn't for want of snoring over night. My, didn't they
go it in them two chairs," cried Tom, gleefully.</p>

<p>"By-and-by madame began to wash cups, and do work. Then one man he say:
'Come, supposing we go up-stairs and see how that pretty bird comes on.
The old woman don't mean to give her any breakfast this morning, by her
washing the dishes so soon.'</p>

<p>"Then madame, she stop short, so, and look much frightened, very cold,
and she say nothing, only look, look."</p>

<p>"Wal, now, I'd a thought better of that 'ere woman, she's disappinted
me," said Tom, settling both hands in his pockets, and planting his feet
apart on the ground. "It's scandless. Wal, now, what did the fellers do
arter that?"</p>

<p>"They go up-stairs and knock; one, two, three times, very loud, then
great noise with feet, and the door open, no one there, bed empty,
garret window open."</p>

<p>"But no ladder, darn 'em&mdash;don't say as I swore now, Paul, cause it's a
lie. I didn't&mdash;Jube and I took care of that 'ere ladder between us.
Golly, how I'd liked to have seen 'em looking out of that 'ere window
like two foxes in a box trap. Wal, what did they do then?"</p>

<p>Paul smiled and looked around to see that no one was within hearing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
"Well, now I tell you, Mr. Tom, they come along tramp, tramp, on the
floor&mdash;great noise and much talk, down the stairs&mdash;madame, she stand
white, like snow, but with her eyes very sparkle. Jube, very brave,
stand close by the stairs. Madame say something quick, then Jube he put
his arm through the iron, so, and hold tight the door, madame go out,
like lightning, and bring long piece of wood from out door. Then Jube
take his arm away and make bar. Bang, bang, but the door no open, very
strong."</p>

<p>Tom, with a spasmodic spreading of his feet and elbows, almost set
himself down into the snow. "He, he, hi, hi, ho, ho-o-o-o!" he shouted,
rolling about in furious glee; "I take it all back; that 'ere woman is a
sneezer&mdash;I give up&mdash;own beat. She knows a thing or two, she does! Bang,
did you say? I reckon it was bang! but, oh, she had 'em tight!"</p>

<p>"Very tight. They kick and call loud, and make great noise, but madame
wash her dish and say nothing. Jube he stand by the fire and laugh; I
laugh, too, very little."</p>

<p>"Laugh! wal, now I reckon you did. If you hadn't I'd a licked yer right
where ye stand, if you be a furrener. I wonder you didn't march right up
and hug the old woman&mdash;I'd a-done it."</p>

<p>"Madame don't like that; she keep on her work, no smile, nothing but
work. The men make more noise; she no take care, but work, work."</p>

<p>"She's a Queen of Shebe, she is. I tell you what, Paul, I'm proud of
that woman. She ought to have been my marm. Wal, so she worked on, and
let 'em take it out in stomping, didn't she?"</p>

<p>"Yes; she work all the time; not seem to hear till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span> somebody open the
gate, then she stop, with the broom in her hand like a staff, and held
her breath, so."</p>

<p>"What was that for?"</p>

<p>"We all hold our breath, for under the heavy step come a soft one like
little child walking. The door it open, and that man from next house
come in, and with him mademoiselle."</p>

<p>"You don't say so. Paul, you furrenir, I dare you to say that over agin.
If you want a licking, do it, that's all!"</p>

<p>"Yes; it was the poor, pretty lady," said Paul, nothing daunted by this
grand threat. "She come in very softly, with the petite bonnet over her
face. She looked like one angel. Madame stood still. She bear on her
broom like a staff, and her eyes open wide. Mademoiselle, she go up to
madame and take her hand. 'Mother,' she say, 'guilty people run away,
and I am not guilty. God knows it, and He is good; so I come back!' Ah,
Monsieur Tom, it broke my heart in pieces to hear her speak so sad, so
sweet. I can't help it, the tears will come!"</p>

<p>"Now don't," said Tom, drawing the sleeve of his jacket across his eyes.
"It's enough to make a feller forget that he's a man!"</p>

<p>Paul went on, twinkling the tears away with his black eyelashes.</p>

<p>"So then she come home once more like a poor little bird that flies
round and round its nest. Madame said no one word, but took
mademoiselle's head, so, between her hands, and kissed her very much,
once, twice. I never saw madame do that till now; it made me sad very
much."</p>

<p>"What did she come back for?" cried Tom. "I can't understand it, no
how."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
"She took off her petite bonnet, and sat down by the fire, holding out
her hands. Then the good man from the house with trees before it, very
tall, he speak to madame so kind, and say that mademoiselle is very
right not to run great way off like guilty people; that the great God
was very strong to take care of her, and she must not have too much
fear, but keep brave heart. Then madame began to cry; oh, how she cry,
with great sobs, like the wind in trees that give all their leaves away
to winter, she say 'God help me, for I am a coward;' and then she goes
to the stairs and opens the door, and says to the men, 'Come down, my
daughter has not run away, she is here.'"</p>

<p>"Then mademoiselle stood up and say&mdash;ah, so sweet: 'Yes, I am here, do
with me as you please;' and a smile was on her mouth like the sun on the
snow, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't, I tell you don't," cried Tom, stamping furiously. "It's enough
to bust a feller's heart, if his jacket was buttoned ever so tight.
She's a brave gal. You, and I, and Jube, may just hang up our fiddles,
for the law's got her now, tight enough. That old Thrasher has done the
business for her this time, anyhow. Gracious, what's that? Look a
there&mdash;didn't I tell you?"</p>

<p>A wagon was coming up the road, slowly ploughing its way through the
muddy snow: a single-seated wagon, with a rush-bottomed chair standing
in front, upon which a man sat conspicuously, driving the horse. In the
seat behind sat another man, with his arm thrown around a slender
female, who shrunk away from his embrace, and cast wild glances toward
the group of school children, that gathered in a crowd by the side of
the road.</p>

<p>"Ah, me, it is her," said Paul, turning his eyes upon the wagon, and
clasping his hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
"Yes," said Tom, and the great tears leaped down his cheeks. "It's no
mistake, them men are the keepers, and that is her. They're taking her
up to the Squire's. It's all day with us, Paul; she'll never sleep in
that brown house agin. Don't shake so, Paul; don't cry like a baby; I
tell you it's enough to make a feller ashamed of your company!"</p>

<p>That moment the wagon came opposite the place where the two boys were
standing: the prisoner saw them, and leaning forward tried to smile.
Tom's bosom heaved, every feature in his face quivered, and then his
feelings broke forth in a burst of tears that shook him from head to
foot.</p>

<p>"Cry, Paul; cry, if you want to! I wont say a word agin it," he sobbed;
"if you and I was giants, fifty feet tall, we needn't be ashamed of
boo-hooing right out at a sight like that. Poor gal, poor gal, she looks
like a blessed lamb between two butchers. Never mind, Paul, cry if you
can't help it. I'll stand between you and the boys&mdash;they know me&mdash;by
jingo, wasn't that one of 'em laughing? I'll maul him, see if I don't."</p>

<p>"Ah, no," said Paul, whose grief had been far less turbulent than that
of his friend, "they not understand it as we do. She would not like you
to fight, or think of any thing wrong. Let us be good, very much, and
perhaps God will take care of her as He took care of Jube and me, when
there was nothing but sky and water, very deep, all around us."</p>

<p>"Oh, why didn't she cut when we got her off!" cried Tom, bursting into a
fresh passion of sobs. "It's like climbing a high tree after a young
bird, and then seeing it flip out of your hand just as you touch ground.
What's the use of being a gineral if your sojers wont work! That old
Thrasher has undid us, Paul."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
"Don't, please!" said Paul, listening. "I can hear the wagon yet, and it
seems to be saying good-by&mdash;good-by. Oh, it is very sad, too sad, Mr.
Tom."</p>

<p>True enough, the wagon was out of hearing, and Katharine Allen proceeded
on her first stage to prison.</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="xliii" id="xliii"></a>CHAPTER XLIII.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">FRIENDS IN COUNCIL.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a mournful council held in Mrs. Allen's house on the morning
after Katharine was carried away to prison. Old Mr. Thrasher and his
wife had gone to the widow's residence early in the day, in great
humility, seeking to share her sorrows, and take the burthen of
Katharine's defence upon themselves. In words, they kept the promise
that the poor girl had extorted, and never mentioned their son in
connection with her, but the truth broke out from their innocent bosoms
in every way. It breathed in their voices, and looked kindly forth from
their eyes. They called Mrs. Allen sister, and there was a tenderness in
the words that no common ideas of brotherhood ever possessed. They spoke
of Katharine as the dear child on whom God had laid a heavy hand, but
who had proved as brave as she was innocent.</p>

<p>All this comforted Mrs. Allen. She had great faith in the justice of
God, and would not believe but that the truth must prevail even against
the iron rule of law. She did not hesitate to accept the aid which Mr.
Thrasher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span> offered, and in one hour those three persons who had been so
far apart two days before formed one little community of grief, and
consoled each other like members of one household.</p>

<p>At first the two women had their secret misgivings, and, dear old
cowards as they were, regretted that Katharine had even rendered herself
up to the laws. Flight seemed to them the only sure way of escaping the
horrors that threatened her. But the old man silenced these secret
repinings with his firm Christian faith. His faith in divine goodness
was perfect; believing Katharine innocent, he trusted her to the laws,
certain that in some way her safety would be wrought out. Still he was
not one of those men who indolently resign every thing into divine hands
without individual effort. While ready to trust, he was equally ready to
work for her deliverance in any way that seemed best.</p>

<p>The doctor came while these three persons were consulting together. A
long ride was before him that day, but he scouted all ideas of fatigue,
and left a host of patients to wait while he rode off to the widow
Allen's in pity to her forlorn condition. Under the eccentricities which
marked this man's character was a fund of sterling good sense and shrewd
worldly knowledge, both of which he brought into the general council,
where it was greatly needed, for three more inexperienced and single
hearted creatures than he found in that kitchen seldom existed, even in
New England, before stage-coaches gave way to railroads. Every face in
the little group brightened when the doctor came in with his usual
quaint joviality, which often covered more true benevolence than people
suspected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
"That's right! all in Indian council round the fire. Something to be
done; you're ready to go at it, and I'm here to help. I say, Thrasher,
if you can't save that girl, don't ever dare to pray in the face of
heaven again."</p>

<p>"It must be a greater than I who saves her," answered the old man,
reverently; "but all that an honest man has power to do I am ready for."</p>

<p>"Well, now give me a chair, Mrs. Allen; don't keep me standing, it's bad
policy; I may be a widower some of these days, can't you understand
that!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen got up and placed a chair for her old friend, who dropped
into it, deposited his crutches conveniently, and began to rub his hands
before the fire.</p>

<p>"Well, now, to begin at the root of the matter, Thrasher. This thing
wants money."</p>

<p>"I have some in the house and more out at interest. Tell me how to use
it best."</p>

<p>"You're a prime old chap. A church full of such members would be enough
to save the whole country, bad as it is. How much money in all,
brother?"</p>

<p>I am afraid the word brother broke into a slight sarcasm on the doctor's
lips, for he rather disliked these empty titles of endearment, and was
apt to laugh at them a little in ordinary times. This one word had
sprung from his heart in spontaneous warmth, but it was so strange to
the lips that they threw it off irreverently.</p>

<p>Mr. Thrasher named a sum of money larger than any one could have
believed at his command.</p>

<p>"It isn't mine," he said, noticing the look of surprise. "My son brought
home all his profits and savings the last voyage, and told me to put
them out at interest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span> and always consider them as mine if I wanted
means. I shall use this money now&mdash;every cent, if needful for her safety
or support."</p>

<p>"You think the girl innocent, then?" said the doctor.</p>

<p>"Innocent as I am," answered the good old man.</p>

<p>"As a baby," chimed in the mild voice of Mrs. Thrasher.</p>

<p>"As the children of heaven," said Mrs. Allen, standing up, and speaking
with all the authority of conviction.</p>

<p>"And this is why you would not let the poor thing run away?" inquired
the doctor, sharply.</p>

<p>The two women looked at each other guiltily. They had been willing
enough that she should run away. It was the sublime faith of the old
man, appealing to a consciousness of innocence in the girl herself, that
had wrought the noble act of self-abnegation, carried out in Katharine's
return.</p>

<p>As for the kind-hearted women, to them Katharine's safety was the first
thought; it was with heavy hearts that they had seen her return like a
bird to the snare.</p>

<p>"Innocent or guilty she was in the hands of her God," answered the old
man. "It was not for weak man like me to wrest her therefrom."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not; but I shall do my best to put all that stuff out of the
lawyers' heads," answered the doctor, dryly.</p>

<p>The two women sighed heavily. Mrs. Thrasher looked a little shocked, and
was troubled with vague misgivings that no lawyer of less strict
principle would be tolerated by her husband.</p>

<p>"We must try and get a conscientious lawyer, if possible," said the old
man, coloring under the doctor's words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
The doctor took up his crutches, and crossed them angrily before him.</p>

<p>"Look here, my old friend, we must divide this work, I see. You shall
take the church and I'll take the law. You pray night and morning, I'll
work morning and night; and if we don't save that poor child in the end,
why it wont be for want of a suitable division of labor."</p>

<p>Mr. Thrasher yielded to this, for he had the great good sense which
gives to every man a clear insight into his own capacities.</p>

<p>"I never had any thing to do with the law in my life," he said, meekly;
"and for the whole world I wouldn't injure her by meddling with what I
don't understand. If you'll undertake it, doctor, I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be content to play second fiddle&mdash;that's exactly what I am up to. Leave
these law matters to me, and if you can do any thing to comfort her&mdash;if
your religion can teach the poor thing to be cheerful or patient, my
part wont be the most important after all. Well, now, Mrs. Allen, what
are you good for? Why didn't you go with the girl?"</p>

<p>"I wished it; but they wouldn't let me. The jail was only for those who
commit crimes, the constable said, and I had no right there."</p>

<p>"But you shall have a right, if I have to sin for you," said the doctor,
dashing his crutch on the floor. "This is what you must arrange. Shut up
the house here; take some of Thrasher's money, and go down to New Haven,
take board close by the jail, and I'll answer for it you shall spend
half your time with Katharine. If Thrasher and his wife could go with
you, all the better&mdash;plenty of time to convert her in the prison. If the
worst comes to the worst, she'll need you, and you can do more good than
fifty ministers."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
"Is it really your advice that I go?" said Mrs. Allen, with painful
eagerness.</p>

<p>"It's my opinion that you should all go; nothing to do in the country at
this time of year. You can comfort one another, and do her a world of
good."</p>

<p>"I'm sure he's right," said Mrs. Thrasher, casting an appealing glance
at her husband. "We might be a great comfort to her. How can we spend
Nelson's money better?"</p>

<p>The old man arose and went out with the doctor, and the two consulted
together some minutes by the gate, then Mr. Thrasher returned.</p>

<p>"There is a thing we have not considered," he said; "these two
strangers. What can be done with them?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen went to a cupboard and took from one of the shelves a New
York Journal, dated months back, in which Mrs. Prior's advertisement for
scholars and boarders was conspicuous.</p>

<p>"These people live in my native town," she said; "it's a long time since
I left it; but Paul would be much better off with this good minister
than here with a broken-hearted old woman. My son has forwarded money
for his support. While this trouble hangs over us, I will send the child
to a happier home; as for Jube, he can stay on the place."</p>

<p>Jube heard this, and clasped his great hands with the sudden shock of
her words. What! part from his little master&mdash;let the boy go off alone
among strangers! It was more than he could bear. But obedience had been
the first lesson of his life, and though every nerve of his heart
protested, he uttered no complaint. Still, as he went heavily about his
work that day, tears were constantly dropping from his eyes, and once he
approached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span> the window with such creeping humility that she half
relented, and was tempted to let him go with his young charge.</p>

<p>But with a true Connecticut woman, industry is one of the leading
virtues. The idea of a stalwart man passing his life in petting a little
boy, was out of the question. True, it was very painful for her to
separate these two singularly matched friends, but it was not in her
nature to encourage idleness, so Paul's destiny for a time was decided.</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="xliv" id="xliv"></a>CHAPTER XLIV.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">THE SEPARATION.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a sad night for Paul&mdash;the saddest, perhaps, of his whole
life&mdash;for hitherto one friend had been with him; now he was to go forth
alone. This was weary trouble; but the boy met it bravely. Being told
with firmness that it was wrong to desire Jube to be always with him, he
hushed down the anguish of that parting, and went away with bitter tears
choked back in his heart.</p>

<p>This story was in the days of carriers and stage-coaches. Paul was
placed in charge of a driver, and early the next morning was to be sent
on his journey. He and Jube spent half an hour in the garret before he
left, and a touching scene passed between those faithful hearts in that
lonely place. Jube sat down on the floor and held the lad in his arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
"You wont forget me, never, little masser?"</p>

<p>"Forget you, Jube, I couldn't do it; never, never; when 'sleep, it will
be Jube who stands by in the dreams that our lady will send. If I pray,
I will ask her to bless Jube."</p>

<p>"Oh, little masser, how Jube's heart aches!"</p>

<p>"And mine, Jube. What shall I do, all alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes, little masser, who will wake you up in the morning and warm your
hands in his?"</p>

<p>"No one," sobbed Paul&mdash;"no one ever will be good to me like you, Jube."</p>

<p>"And you'll want Jube?"</p>

<p>"Want you&mdash;oh, very much."</p>

<p>Jube gathered the little fellow to his bosom and cried over him in
forlorn silence.</p>

<p>"Little masser?"</p>

<p>"Well, Jube?" was the mournful answer.</p>

<p>"I'll try, little masser&mdash;I'll do very much to stay in this house when
you're gone; but don't be frightened if I come often. Masser," sobbed
the negro, "it does me good to say 'little masser,' but to-morrow no one
will hear me."</p>

<p>Paul clung to his friend. "But I shall know it. In my soul I shall hear
Jube's voice saying, 'little masser.'"</p>

<p>The rattle of wheels disturbed them. Tom Hutchins had driven up in his
father's yellow wagon, and sat cracking his whip, ready to convey Paul
to the stage house, where the doctor was waiting to see his youthful
friend off. There was brief leave-taking between Mrs. Allen and her
son's prot&eacute;g&eacute;. The sorrows that possessed her were so absorbing that all
lesser griefs passed as nothing. She kissed the boy with a mournful
farewell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span> and saw him driven away heavy-hearted and heavy eyed,
wondering that any one, even a child, could feel sorrow for so slight a
cause.</p>

<p>Jube, poor, faithful Jube, lifted Paul into the wagon, folded the
checked blanket which draped the seat tenderly around him, and turned
away, covering his face with both hands.</p>

<p>When Paul looked back to wave his last adieu, Jube was following down
the road with long strides. He soon reached the wagon, and kept up with
it,
<a name="notwithstanding" id="notwithstanding"></a><ins title="Original has nowithstanding">notwithstanding</ins> Tom's splendid driving, till they
reached the stage house on the hill at Chewstown.</p>

<p>The stage was not in, and Tom sat in magnificent state by his foreign
friend, snapping his whip and holding in his horse, which was made
restive by the noise, with great force. What between grief at his
friend's departure and the glory of driving a young horse for the first
time, that precocious Jehu was in a state of wonderful excitement. But
when the stage-coach came in, with its tin horn sounding over the hills,
and a crack of whips that startled the whole neighborhood, Tom folded up
his lash in despair, and shrinking into the insignificance of a
one-horse wagon, gave way to his counter passion and became inconsolable
over Paul's departure.</p>

<p>"I don't wonder you look so, Jube," he said, addressing the negro. "The
idea of sending him off without you&mdash;it's downright scandlous. Now if it
was me I'd cut. Catch a chap about this size staying behind to please an
old woman! I wouldn't do it!"</p>

<p>"Ha, what is that? What you say, Masser Tom? Cut&mdash;what is cut?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
Before Tom could explain his meaning to the negro, the doctor rode up
and shook Paul by the hand.</p>

<p>"Come, hop out, my little shaver&mdash;seat all ready&mdash;driver's got his
orders. Here's a letter that you must give Mr. Prior, that's a good boy.
Open the door, driver&mdash;lift him up, cuffy&mdash;ho, heave, ho!"</p>

<p>The stage took a splendid sweep, that nearly broke Tom's heart with
envy, then swung down the sand banks across the bridge and away.</p>

<p>Paul leaned from a window, and wildly flung kisses back to his friends.
Jube shaded his eyes with one hand, but tears dropped heavy and thick
from under it, while Tom jumped out of his wagon, and ran after the
doctor.</p>

<p>"Doctor, I say, you jest listen to reason. That ere nigger is breaking
his consarned black heart 'cause you amongst you wont let him go with
Paul. It's a burning shame of you, doctor; he'll jest pine away into a
consumption; and that'll be what you have done."</p>

<p>"Why, Tom, what is all this about? I haven't kept your snowball; he can
roll where he pleases for any thing I care about it."</p>

<p>"And you didn't set the widder up to this, doctor?"</p>

<p>"Set her up to it?&mdash;no."</p>

<p>"Doctor, give us your hand. I ought to have known better. If ever there
was a chap that I look up to he isn't far off from this 'dentical hoss.
If you'd gin orders for cuff to stay, stay he should, right or wrong;
but if it's only a specimen of woman's work, then Jube is his own boss.
A woman's a woman, and a nigger is a nigger&mdash;neither uv 'em can vote or
train according to law. Then what right has one over
<a name="other" id="other"></a><ins title="Original has 'tother,">t'other</ins> I
should like to know?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
The doctor's eyes twinkled under their heavy brows.</p>

<p>"That is logic," he said, leading the boy on. "If women could vote,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If wimmin could vote!" exclaimed Tom, with magnificent disdain. "The
idee! Who'd take care of the young ones while they trapsed about
'lection days? Well, I reckon it wouldn't be me&mdash;I've had enough of that
'ere."</p>

<p>"Well, Tom, as women can't vote, and have no right to order negroes,
what course would you advise Jube to take?"</p>

<p>"Cut, doctor; that's what I'd do in this case!"</p>

<p>"Well, if he wants to cut, and has the money to afford it, I don't see
the harm."</p>

<p>"You don't? Hurrah, Jube! You don't?&mdash;that's enough. Good-by, doctor."</p>

<p>Away the lad rushed, and sprang with a bound into the wagon.</p>

<p>"Come, Jube&mdash;hurry up. I've got something splendid to say to you. Jump
in, and I don't mind driving you over the hill. Chirk up, old fellow,
we'll be after him yet, but I'll think it over till morning."</p>

<p>Jube obeyed this boisterous summons, and climbed into the wagon.</p>

<p>The next day, Mrs. Allen left her house, and took up her lonely abode in
New Haven. Old Mr. Thrasher went with her, leaving his wife behind for a
few days, when she too would give up her home. Jube was left alone in
the house, alone in the cruel cold, so heartbroken and desolate that he
had not sufficient energy to build a fire, or cook necessary food. Tom
was right&mdash;a few weeks of this life would have killed the noble fellow
outright. On the third day after Paul left, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span> was sitting drearily on
the hearth, with his feet in the ashes, when Tom came in.</p>

<p>"Just as I expected," he said, dropping into Mrs. Allen's high-backed
chair. "Down in the mouth&mdash;clean give up&mdash;not worth salt."</p>

<p>Jube did not speak, but sat supporting his head with both hands, looking
gloomily into the ashes.</p>

<p>"Look a here, cuff, to-morrow is stage day agin."</p>

<p>"I know it," said Jube. "The doctor stopped here and told me."</p>

<p>"He did?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, why didn't you take the hint?"</p>

<p>Jube looked at Tom, with a languid question in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Pick up your money, jump on the top of the stage, and dash away after
Paul. That's what he meant by coming here."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! what that?" cried Jube, starting to his feet.</p>

<p>"Now, don't go off the handle; but pack up your bundle, and be off in
the morning. What are you skeered about? What's the use of working when
you've got lots an' lots of cash? Just up and go after Paul. He's
breaking his heart, and so are you; besides, this old house is enough to
set a feller crazy. I couldn't stand it. Just up and go; that's my
advice. The doctor'll make it all right with the old woman."</p>

<p>"But the animals&mdash;the poor cow and the birds&mdash;who feed them when Jube
gone?"</p>

<p>"That's exactly what I come about. If it hadn't been for that
difficulty, I'd a had you off afore this. I've been talking to par about
the chores to hum, and he's kinder promised to let me off from part of
'em and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span> give me time to stop here on my way to school and back. I'll
take care of the critters and feed the chickens till some of 'em get
home again; so don't worry yourself about them, but chirk up and act
like a man. What are you looking away for? Don't it suit you?"</p>

<p>Jube turned his face upon the boy; a face all quivering and aglow with
happiness.</p>

<p>"Oh, Masser Tom, a great rock is lifted right off from my heart. Masser
Paul! Masser Paul!"</p>

<p>"It wont take you more than a day to get there."</p>

<p>"One day? to-morrow night? no more?" questioned the negro, earnestly.</p>

<p>"Jes so. Now pack up and I'll drive you over to the stage house, consarn
me, if I wont; for, cuffy or no cuffy, you are a prime feller, Jube, and
I aint ashamed of your acquaintance. It's an honor, Jube, and I feel
it."</p>

<p>The next morning Tom sat in his father's yellow wagon in front of the
stage house, while Jube, smiling till all his teeth shone, again waved
an adieu from the top of the stage.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Jube; tell Paul not to forget old Bungy and the folks that's
in it."</p>

<p>Jube smiled broadly.</p>

<p>"Tell him to come back in the spring."</p>

<p>Jube lost his message, for the stage went off, scattering a storm of mud
from its wheels, and thundering down the sand banks with a flourish of
whips that aggravated Tom's unhappiness beyond measure.</p>

<p>"Never mind," he muttered, turning his horse to follow on the same road.
"If Rose Mason only knew I was driving this young critter that she used
to consider so harnsome, she wouldn't think that stage any thing
tremendous, loud as the driver cracks his whip."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
With these consoling fragments of thought, Tom followed in the wake of
the stage, trying his whip as he crossed the bridge in a manner that
made his young steed plunge and jump on one side with a violence that
brought the boy's heart into his mouth. While he was busy subduing the
spirited animal the doctor rode on to the bridge and watched the
conflict. It was soon over, for Tom had ignominiously given up by
thrusting his whip under the seat in great dismay.</p>

<p>"Well, what's the news, Tom?" inquired the doctor, as he rode by.</p>

<p>"Nothing special sir, only Jube has cut. Going up the hill yonder on top
of the stage. I say, you'll just make it all right with Mrs. Allen,
doctor?"</p>

<p>The doctor nodded, chuckled softly, and rode on.</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="xlv" id="xlv"></a>CHAPTER XLV.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">PAUL FINDS A NEW HOME.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> more the stage swung to at minister Prior's gate, and this time a
slender boy, with a beauty of countenance that made you hold your
breath, was lifted through the door, and set carefully down upon the
grass.</p>

<p>Mr. Prior, who had been dreaming over his sermon in the study, came out,
looking bland as a summer's morning, and was accosted by the driver:</p>

<p>"I say, minister, I always bring luck. Here is one of the nicest little
shavers that ever you saw. He wants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span> to come to school, and I've told
him that you'll be a father to him, and as for Mrs. Prior&mdash;well, there's
no doing that lady justice."</p>

<p>Mr. Prior smiled pleasantly, and went up to Paul.</p>

<p>"He is indeed a fine boy."</p>

<p>"Thank you, monsieur," said Paul, taking a letter, which the doctor had
given him, from his pocket. "When you read this perhaps you tell more
sure if I can stay here."</p>

<p>Mr. Prior glanced over the letter, and smiled down with hospitable
kindness into Paul's anxious eyes.</p>

<p>"It would be difficult to answer no, even if we wished it," he said,
kindly; "an orphan and a stranger&mdash;it is from such I fancy that the
angels come to us unawares."</p>

<p>"You will not find me too much trouble," said Paul, smiling. "I study
English good deal&mdash;try always."</p>

<p>"French is your native language, I think?"</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur!"</p>

<p>"Then we will soon find a lady who can talk with you; come, my little
man."</p>

<p>The minister led Paul into the house, speaking to him kindly enough,
although, in his shyness, he was always sadly at a loss what to say to
any child, and the boy looked so sorrowful at parting with his friend
that the clergyman was in doubt what manner of argument to employ by way
of consolation.</p>

<p>He gave the little fellow a seat in the parlor, and went away to find
Mrs. Prior, and inform her of the arrival of her new pupil. She hurried
in at once, and her motherly kindness soon made Paul, in a measure,
forget his loneliness and desolation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mason and Rose had gone out to walk; so, for an hour or two, the
little woman gave the boy her undivided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span> attention. He refused dinner,
saying they had dined on the road; but Mrs. Prior, out of the experience
of her schoolmistress days, had great faith in the unlimited powers of
children in the way of voraciousness, so she brought him all manner of
quaint shaped cakes and crullers, red apples and nuts, until Paul was
confused by the abundance, and sat with them on the handkerchief laid
across his lap, staring ruefully at the pile, and really not knowing
where to begin.</p>

<p>But what comforted Paul more than any thing was to hear himself
addressed in his native language, which Mrs. Prior spoke with a
sufficient degree of fluency.</p>

<p>"I have a little girl here," she said, "who will be a nice playmate for
you."</p>

<p>"Is she a pretty little girl?" Paul asked; for he possessed a keen
appreciation of beauty.</p>

<p>"Very pretty; her name is Rose, and she is nice and sweet, like her
name."</p>

<p>Paul was interested at once, and poured forth a flood of questions with
such volubility that it required all Mrs. Prior's knowledge of French to
follow him. When he learned that it was the very Rose that Tom Hutchins
had talked of so much, he felt at once that he had fallen among old
friends, and his face brightened till its singular beauty became a
marvel in the eyes of the minister's little wife.</p>

<p>Before Mrs. Mason and her daughter returned, Paul and his hostess had
become the best friends imaginable. He grew very confidential, made her
cry heartily with a few words which conveyed an account of his mother's
death, and she brightened at the story of his rescue at sea, and in her
gentle heart blessed the rough sailor of whom Paul spoke so lovingly. In
the glow of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span> benevolent feelings she determined to do every thing
in her power to make the child's residence in her family a happy episode
in his life.</p>

<p>When she heard Mrs. Mason and little Rose in the hall, Mrs. Prior went
out and asked them to come in.</p>

<p>"I want your daughter and my new charge to be good friends," she said,
pleasantly, to Mrs. Mason.</p>

<p>"I will see him before I give any answer, if you please," replied that
lady, who grew more haughty and insolent every day.</p>

<p>"His society could not fail to be of benefit to any child," returned
Mrs. Prior, annoyed, as often happened now, by the imperious manner of
her boarder. "He is the most perfect little gentleman I ever saw in my
life."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mason made an effort to look somewhat doubtful of Mrs. Prior's
judgment in such matters, but there was a certain dignity in the lady's
manner which checked further insolence.</p>

<p>Indeed, Mrs. Mason herself was wonderfully struck with the boy's
delicacy of features and refinement of manner, the moment she saw him.
Her curiosity was excited, and she asked innumerable questions, which
Paul answered evasively, for his childish instincts prejudiced him
against the beautiful woman at once.</p>

<p>But the little girl and he soon opened friendly relations, after the
first shyness, natural to children, had worn off. In the corner, where
Paul was taken to admire her dolls, all fast asleep, as good dolls
should be when visitors come on them unawares, she began to question him
at once. What child would not? He told her of his perilous sea life, and
of the beautiful country where he once lived, but there were scenes in
that life so dark and terrible that the boy's heart shrunk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span> away from
them even in thought. To have mentioned them in childish play would have
proved beyond his power. Among these were the blows that had been dealt
on Jube, and all his miserable life in that brig.</p>

<p>Another subject which he never mentioned was the story of poor
Katharine. Mrs. Allen, shrinking from the idea that her daughter's
disgrace should be carried to her native town, had cautioned Paul never
to mention their names, and he obeyed her faithfully.</p>

<p>The doctor had obtained a letter from a clergyman in New Haven to Mr.
Prior, which the boy had brought as an introduction, and that was all
the information necessary.</p>

<p>Thus, though Paul and Rose became good friends, he never spoke of the
people or scenes which they knew in common.</p>

<p>When bedtime came, Paul went up to the pretty little room prepared for
him with considerable hesitation, as he had always had Jube near for
comfort and protection.</p>

<p>However, he was too manly for a single remonstrance, and when Mrs. Prior
kissed him good-night at the door, he knelt for his prayers, and
hastened to bed with all speed.</p>

<p>When he was safely in bed, and the warmth began to make him feel
somewhat less disconsolate, Mrs. Prior came to take away the candle,
through fear of imaginary accidents.</p>

<p>"Are you comfortable?" she asked, stopping to look at him, as he lay
with his classical head visible above the clothes.</p>

<p>"Very," Paul said.</p>

<p>"Sleep well, and try to be happy," she returned, giving him another
kiss, out of the tenderness of her heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
"Thank you, madame," Paul said, touched, as he always was, by any
evidence of kindness. "I like you very much, very much."</p>

<p>Mrs. Prior was not half way down-stairs before Paul was quietly asleep.
Fatigue kept him from dwelling upon this new change. Indeed, he had
grown so accustomed to removals and strangers that he received them with
very different feelings from those which would formerly have troubled
him.</p>

<h2><a name="xlvi" id="xlvi"></a>CHAPTER XLVI.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">JUBE FINDS HIS WAY TO BAYS HOLLOW.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning, while Paul and Rose were playing in the
dining-room&mdash;the little girl having been granted a holiday on account of
the boy's arrival&mdash;there arose in the kitchen a sudden commotion, which
attracted Mrs. Prior's attention. She went out, and found her little
handmaiden in conversation with an immense negro, who looked so
good-natured and anxious, that it was a wonder he could have frightened
anybody, although the girl appeared somewhat inclined to run away.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Prior entered, the man turned toward her with a ponderous bow.</p>

<p>"What do you want, my good man?" she asked, gently.</p>

<p>"My young masser is here," Jube said, with another salute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
"Your young master?"</p>

<p>"Yes; Masser Paul."</p>

<p>"Are you his servant?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if madame pleases. Jube came with him from the old home, saw the
mistress buried, and has been wandering about with little masser ever
since."</p>

<p>"He told me about you," said Mrs. Prior.</p>

<p>"Yes, madame. So when madame sent masser away, Jube meant to stay there
and take care of the house. But Jube would have died&mdash;came after little
masser. Please take me, madame. Jube can work; he'll do any thing, big,
big, strong."</p>

<p>He extended his stalwart arms as a proof of his words, and Mrs. Prior
was touched by his earnestness.</p>

<p>"We have no need of any more help," she said.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; Jube be great help&mdash;jis take me, madame, you see&mdash;no be
sorry, no indeed."</p>

<p>"I would willingly, for the child's sake, but we are not rich; my
husband could not afford to pay you wages."</p>

<p>"Jube not want wages&mdash;no good of money. Please let Jube stay, lady."</p>

<p>Mrs. Prior went up to the study to hold a private consultation with her
husband; while she was gone, Paul and Rose passed through the kitchen.</p>

<p>At the sight of the negro, the boy gave a cry of delight, and rushed
into his arms, with a burst of tears and wild ejaculations. Jube sobbed
aloud, and it was some time before either of them could in the least
recover their composure.</p>

<p>Rose stood looking at them in great astonishment; but when Paul managed
to explain that this was the Jube of whom he had told her, she cried and
laughed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span> also, from pure sympathy, while the handmaiden worked herself
into such a state of bewilderment that she laid the forks where the
spoons belonged, put an empty tin pan into the oven, instead of the
pudding, which was ready for baking, and performed a variety of other
wonderful feats, which brought great disgrace upon her shortly after.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Prior and the clergyman came down-stairs, they found Paul
nestled close to his old friend, and looking so happy that the very idea
of refusing the negro's request sent a pang to their hearts.</p>

<p>"Jube must stay," Paul cried, in his exquisitely persuasive way; "please
to say yes, good madame&mdash;shan't he stay, sir?"</p>

<p>The clergyman looked at his wife, and she looked back at him; both were
extremely perplexed.</p>

<p>"Jube no want wages," said the negro, "only wants to live near little
masser."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is all," added Paul.</p>

<p>"We certainly cannot have the man," Mrs. Prior said to her husband.</p>

<p>"That is out of the question," he replied.</p>

<p>"But what can we do?"</p>

<p>"Settle it yourself, Mrs. Prior; your decision is sure to be a correct
and wise one."</p>

<p>With these complimentary words, the minister helped himself out of his
difficulty by leaving the room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Prior looked at the friends in great trouble; but little Paul
approached her chair and put his arms about her neck; Rose clung to her
hand and added her entreaties; while Jube gazed at her with his great,
honest eyes.</p>

<p>The result of all this affair was, that Jube insisted on making himself
so agreeable, and began at once to demonstrate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span> his powers of usefulness
so acceptably that there was really no turning him out of doors.</p>

<p>The good fellow had some mechanical genius, and exerted it to the
delight of little Rose in furnishing her play-house, and building sleds
and wagons for Paul, large enough for her to ride in. Then, Jube made
such a splendid horse, and never got tired of carrying her or drawing
the little sled on which she rode. When she expressed a wish to ride on
horseback, Jube lifted her to his broad shoulders, or put out his foot,
which instantly swung itself into full canter, and away she went,
rushing off to "Canterbury Cross" in high glee.</p>

<p>To Mrs. Prior, both Jube and his little master were objects of peculiar
interest. Paul was eloquent in his own language, and through its medium
he conveyed many pleasant fancies to the mind of Rose, and thus, all in
play, brought her through the first practice of a study her mother had
greatly at heart.</p>

<p>As the winter snows melted, and the sweet spring days came on, it was
pleasant to see Jube seated with the children&mdash;at heart, almost as much
of a child as either of them&mdash;beneath a huge apple tree that stood in
the meadow, and covered one of the most lovely strawberry slopes in the
world with its shadow.</p>

<p>As the bright days came on, the favor of instruction was not altogether
on one side. Rose had her own little accomplishments, which she taught
in shy triumph in exchange for the sweet language and pretty names
bestowed on her. She taught Paul how to curl dandelion stems into
innumerable ringlets, and made an astonishing halter of daisy chains for
Jube, that was not the less perfect because it broke into a shower of
white blossoms at the first hard pull, and littered the grass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span> like a
snow-storm. Then she could braid rushes seven strands at a time, and
weave them into such pretty green baskets that Mrs. Prior considered
them the pet ornaments of her parlor.</p>

<p>Besides these accomplishments, Rose had a delicious voice, and sung
snatches of music at her work. These wild strains so excited the robins
in the apple tree boughs that they forgot nest-building and love-making,
to join in a chorus that rang all over the meadow, bringing other birds
to see what it was all about, who liked the premises, and built their
nests also among the sweet blossoms and leaves of dainty green, till the
old tree was a marvel for its feathered population.</p>

<p>I am afraid Rose sometimes followed Paul up into the apple tree, taking
shy peeps at the pretty blue eggs which he exposed by sweeping the soft
leaves back from the nest with his hands. Once or twice Mrs. Prior found
her in a corner of the garret, making desperate efforts to darn a long
rent in her dress, and crying bitterly because the cloth would draw into
knots and gathers under her hand, more conspicuous than the original
tear had been, which must have strengthened this suspicion about the
apple tree very much.</p>

<p>Of course the good lady remedied this evil with her own deft little
fingers, and Mrs. Mason was too busy with other things just then to heed
torn frocks or the shamefacedness which on ordinary occasions would have
betrayed them.</p>

<p>Thus time wore on, till Mrs. Mason had become a dashing performer on the
piano, for she practiced day and night on the accomplishments that she
willed to master, and in every thing made up for deficiencies by
audacious self-possession. Thus, while Rose and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span> birds were singing
out of doors, she sent a storm of music through the open windows, which
were just far enough from the apple tree to excite the birds without
frightening them to death.</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="xlvii" id="xlvii"></a>CHAPTER XLVII.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">A CHILDISH CONSULTATION.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> life which these children and their companion led at Bays Hollow was
quiet and peaceful, especially to those strange beings, after the
privations and bitter troubles through which they had passed. The
mournful look that had seemed natural to Paul, went out from his eyes,
which grew soft or bright with changing feelings, but the haggard
anguish which had made their glance so painfully sad, never came back to
them. As for Jube, he was like a Newfoundland dog&mdash;full of courage,
strength, and cheerfulness.</p>

<p>The minister and Mrs. Prior were a great deal happier for having these
children in the house. Indeed Mrs. P. put on the most awkward little
maternal airs, like a great girl beginning to play with dolls late in
life, for which the minister admired her prodigiously. Once, when they
were quite alone, he observed in a dreamy way, "That it was a sad pity
such talent for government should be exhausted on other people's
children," at which Mrs. Prior went off in a spasm of blushes, and the
minister crept out of the room, quite ashamed of himself, feeling that
he had approached the verge of total depravity in that unhappy speech.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
One day when Paul and Jube were busy among the strawberry vines in the
meadow, searching, with great anxiety, for the first tinge of red upon
the slowly ripening fruit, for the boy was eager to secure a handful for
little Rose, that young lady was seen dashing through the back door of
the house, and running full speed toward the strawberry hollow. Paul
started up and shook his head to indicate that there was no hope of
strawberries yet, while Jube, who was on all fours among the vines,
lifted his broad face like an expectant dog, and laughed till all his
teeth shone again, with the joyousness of her approach.</p>

<p>On she came, rushing through the fresh wind, her curls floating out
behind her, and her face full of wild excitement.</p>

<p>"Something is the matter," said Paul, stepping forward to meet her. "Who
has frightened Rose, I should like to know?"</p>

<p>"Paul, Paul, come here, under the apple tree," were the first breathless
words of our little girl. "I want to tell you something."</p>

<p>Paul took her hand with his usual gentle kindness, and the two ran to
the apple tree's shade.</p>

<p>"This is it," said Rose, panting for breath, while her eyes sparkled
like diamonds. "He has come&mdash;that man who loves my mother so much. He's
a going to marry her right off, as sure as you live. Marry her&mdash;my own,
own mother&mdash;who never will love me again after that; never, never!"</p>

<p>Rose burst into a passion of tears, and flinging herself against the
trunk of the tree wept bitterly.</p>

<p>Paul was greatly troubled; not that he understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span> the matter, but
because it grieved him to see Rose cry so bitterly.</p>

<p>"Oh," she exclaimed, dropping two dimpled hands from her eyes, and
stamping her tiny feet on the grass, "oh dear, how I wish that Captain
Thrasher was dead."</p>

<p>Paul started, and turned very pale. "Jube, Jube," he called out, with a
cry of pain.</p>

<p>Jube started up from his knees, and came running toward the children.</p>

<p>"What is it&mdash;what is it, little masser?"</p>

<p>"He is here, that bad man&mdash;he wants to marry Rose's mother," cried the
lad, flinging his arms around the little girl, and looking the brave,
bright boy he really was.</p>

<p>"Who, who, little masser?" cried Jube, looking around for some enemy.</p>

<p>"Captain Thrasher." Paul uttered the name in a whisper.</p>

<p>Jube clenched his hand, looking fiercely toward the house.</p>

<p>"He there, Masser Paul?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the angry child, shaking her little rosebud of a fist at the
house. "He's there with my own mother, this minute. He'll carry her off
in spite of us all."</p>

<p>"What can we do?" said Paul, anxiously looking at Jube.</p>

<p>"Couldn't you just kill him, Jube, as you did the garter snake," cried
Rose, shaking the drops from her eager eyes.</p>

<p>Jube hesitated; the fellow had a vague idea that some one might object
to this mode of settling the difficulty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span> Paul drew back with affright.
He had received a cruel knowledge of the laws regarding human life, and
the remedy pointed out by little Rose made him shrink.</p>

<p>"We must not ask Jube to be wicked," he said, gently.</p>

<p>Rose dashed his hand away. "Isn't it wicked for that man to come here
after my own mother?" she cried, indignantly.</p>

<p>"Yes, Rose; but it would be more wicked for Jube to harm him. The law,
Rose, the law."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't care. What is the law? If it's a man, Jube can whip him,
can't you, Jube?" cried the little damsel, going for belligerent rights
with all her puny strength.</p>

<p>"But it isn't a man, Rose," said Paul, solemnly. "It's something that no
one ever sees. It comes like death, and when a person does wrong, even
if it was a beautiful lady, strikes her down till her heart breaks. It
shuts people up in prison."</p>

<p>"Oh don't, don't," cried Rose.</p>

<p>"It hangs 'em by the neck between two beams."</p>

<p>"Oh, how you frighten me, Paul."</p>

<p>"It hunts after a person who has done wrong, day and night, and catches
him at last. Oh, Rose, if you only knew how cruel the law can be."</p>

<p>Rose hushed her sobs and drew close to Paul, quite awe-stricken. "Never
mind, Jube needn't do it. I'll ask the minister to pray God to help us,
that will be the best thing."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Paul, brightening, "and I'll&mdash;no matter about that, people
shouldn't talk about these things, but 'our Lady' has done great things
for people in distress."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
They sat down in a group under the apple tree, consulting eagerly
together. After awhile the parlor window opened, and a clear, ringing
voice called out:</p>

<p>"Rose! Rose Mason, I say."</p>

<p>"I must go," said the little girl, with a look of deplorable
helplessness. "She'll want me to kiss him, but I wont!"</p>

<p>Paul lifted her little hand to his lips, and kissed it with touching
grace.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid, Rose. Jube wont let anybody hurt you."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I aint afraid," cried Rose, tossing her golden curls. "He daren't
kiss me, I know that."</p>

<p>She went away slowly, looking over her shoulder from time to time during
her progress toward the house. The apple tree was not within sight of
the parlor windows, thus both Jube and Paul remained unseen by the two
people who occupied that room; an unfortunate circumstance, perhaps, for
their recognition might have changed the whole course of events. As it
was, both Paul and Jube were anxious to keep out of sight. When they
left the meadow, Paul went to his room, and in the simplicity of his
faith, put up many an orison to the Virgin, in behalf of this pretty
friend. What else could the child do?</p>



<hr />

<a name="xlviii" id="xlviii"></a>CHAPTER XLVIII.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">PAUL SEES HIS MOTHER'S NECKLACE.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> Rose left the parlor she was so frightened and subdued by her
mother's stern reprimands, that all idea of appealing for help forsook
her. So she ran desperately into a closet connected with her mother's
chamber, fell upon the floor, and cried herself to sleep, with her
flushed cheeks resting on two round arms, folded helplessly on the bare
boards.</p>

<p>Toward night, Mrs. Mason came up-stairs, looking haughty and excited.
Without heeding the child, who lay just within the closet, with her
curls scattered over the threshold of the door, she began to open trunks
and bureaus, from which she drew first a heavy silk dress, which just
escaped being white by a tinge of pearl gray, some gossamer laces, and
other indications of an elaborate toilet. Then she let down her
magnificent hair, brushed out its glossy waves, and began to braid it;
stopping now and then to rest her arms on the table before her, and
sighing heavily, as if it required all her energies to keep up that
proud show of strength.</p>

<p>After wreathing these heavy braids around her head in the form of a
coronet, she arose and went to the closet for something. Lo, there was
her child prone upon the floor, disturbed by her approach, and moaning
at her feet.</p>

<p>A person who deliberately does wrong, is almost sure to be angry at any
thing calculated to touch the conscience. Mrs. Mason's cheeks flushed
and her eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span> flashed at the sight of little Rose. She was tempted to
spurn the child with her foot, but restrained herself, only touching the
bare, white shoulder, with the point of her slipper.</p>

<p>"Get up, child. Get up. What on earth are you doing here?"</p>

<p>The touch awoke Rose. She started to her feet, and tried to shrink away.</p>

<p>"Stop, you naughty, disobedient child!" cried the mother, seizing her by
the shoulder. "You don't deserve it; but see what a beautiful present
Mr. Thrasher has brought you&mdash;coral and pure gold&mdash;for your arms and
neck. There, Rosey posey, don't it make your eyes dance?"</p>

<p>The little girl's eyes did sparkle for a moment, but directly they
filled with tears.</p>

<p>"No, mother; it's very pretty, but I don't want any thing," she said,
timidly.</p>

<p>The mother frowned.</p>

<p>"Go to Mrs. Prior this instant," she said; "tell her to dress you in the
India muslin frock that I gave out to be done up. Loop the sleeves with
this coral. Mind and let Mr. Thrasher see it on your neck and arms. Oh,
Mrs. Prior, I'm glad you've come! Please have this child properly
dressed. There are the ornaments; go, Rose, I have no time to spare; be
a good girl, and look pretty to please mother."</p>

<p>"I'll&mdash;I'll try," sobbed the child, "only don't make me wear them."</p>

<p>"Hush, or you'll make me angry, my dear. Mrs. Prior, if you would hurry
with her, and help me a little, I really am so nervous."</p>

<p>"No wonder," answered Mrs. Prior, gravely, "the whole thing is so
sudden."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
"Not with me," was the cold answer. "The day was settled the last time
Mr. Thrasher visited us; but I did not think it necessary to make it a
subject of conversation with strangers."</p>

<p>"But we might have been better prepared," said Mrs. Prior.</p>

<p>"Not at all necessary, as we go away in an hour after the ceremony is
performed."</p>

<p>"Go away, Mrs. Mason?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"And little Rose?"</p>

<p>The good woman's voice trembled.</p>

<p>"Ah, she will stay with you, heaven only knows how long! that is, if you
will keep her&mdash;say at the price we have been paying for both. She will
have the piano for practice, and you can keep the furniture to remember
me by."</p>

<p>"You are very kind."</p>

<p>"Not at all; I know you will be good to Rose."</p>

<p>"Indeed I will!"</p>

<p>"And give her every accomplishment. Remember, money is of no
consequence."</p>

<p>"That which you offer is more than enough to pay for all the knowledge
or accomplishments I can teach," said the little woman, conscientiously.</p>

<p>"If it isn't, say so, and we'll double it," answered Mrs. Mason, with
reckless munificence. "There is gold enough in my work-box there to pay
for three or four years, if we do not send for her before that. You can
take box and all after we're gone, for I shall leave all these things
behind; it's too much trouble to pack them up. Use what you like, and
cut over the rest for Rose&mdash;the dresses, I mean. That brown silk for
travelling will be all I shall care for after the ceremony is over."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
"I hardly know how to receive this liberality," said the little woman,
with tears in her eyes. "It don't seem right to accept it."</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense! Be a mother to Rose, and seem glad to see us when we come
after her. You have been very kind to me, Mrs. Prior, and I feel it now,
indeed I do."</p>

<p>There was a touch of genuine feeling in Mrs. Mason's voice, as she bent
forward and kissed Mrs. Prior on the cheek, with lips that were red and
dewy as rose-buds. In her selfishness, she had not noticed Rose, who
stood clinging to Mrs. Prior's dress, growing paler and paler at each
word.</p>

<p>"Mother, are you going to leave me all alone!"</p>

<p>There was so much of sorrow in the child's voice that it reached even
that vain heart.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Rosey, dear," said the mother, kissing the pale lips of her
child. "It wont be long; besides, Mrs. Prior loves you dearly, and will
be very kind."</p>

<p>"Indeed I will, darling," sobbed the little woman. "So now cheer up,
Rose, and run off to be dressed," added the mother, beginning to tire of
the scene; "do try and help me, Mrs. Prior, and see that your husband is
ready; there must be no delay, for we have a long ride before us."</p>

<p>Mrs. Prior hurried off with Rose to her own private room, and in a
marvellous short time the little girl came forth airy as a butterfly.
The red coral glowing on her face and neck, the India muslin floating
around her like a cloud.</p>

<p>Rose met Paul in the upper passage. He was looking sadly troubled. She
went toward him and laid her hand in his.</p>

<p>"You are going?" he said, interpreting the act from his fears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
"No, <i>they</i> are going, Paul, but I am to be left behind."</p>

<p>The boy began to smile.</p>

<p>"And Mrs. Prior will be your mother?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Ah! I'm so happy, so glad; let me go tell Jube."</p>

<p>He attempted to descend the stairs but came back again.</p>

<p>"One thing, Rose. I should like to see this gentleman, Captain
Thrasher."</p>

<p>"Well, he's in the parlor."</p>

<p>"But I don't want him to see me."</p>

<p>"Oh, then I can't help you, Paul&mdash;there's no way."</p>

<p>Paul looked disappointed. That moment Mrs. Prior came toward them from
Mrs. Mason's room.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Paul?" she inquired, kindly.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing," answered Rose, "only he wants to see that hateful man."</p>

<p>"For shame, Rose!"</p>

<p>"Well, he wants to see Captain Thrasher, and he don't want Captain
Thrasher to see him!" persisted Rose, shaking her head with pretty
defiance.</p>

<p>"He wants to see a marriage&mdash;is that it?" said Mrs. Prior, whose kind
heart was always prompting her to the pleasure of others. "And you would
like to have a peep at this wedding? Rose, you will go into the room;
but it is to be very private, you know, and I can't let you in, Paul."</p>

<p>"No, no, I do not wish&mdash;I only want to see," cried the boy, eagerly; "I
and Jube&mdash;one little minute, that is all."</p>

<p>Mrs. Prior smiled and dropped into a moment's thought.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "as you have set your heart upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span> it, Paul, there can
be no harm in letting you see them married so long as it disturbs no
one. There is the door between the parlor and dining-room; the upper
half is glass. Just lift the curtain softly and look through; but
remember, there must be no talking about it. The whole thing is to be
kept secret."</p>

<p>"I will not speak to any one, be sure," said Paul.</p>

<p>"Well, be in your room and I will call you at the right time," said Mrs.
Prior; "but hurry away, now, for she'll be going down-stairs in a
minute."</p>

<p>Paul went to his room. Scarcely had he disappeared when Mrs. Mason came
forth; the thick silken folds of her dress rustling sumptuously, and
with a carcanet of gems flashing its tinted flame over the snow of her
neck and shoulders.</p>

<p>When Rose saw her mother the color died from her face and she shivered
as if with cold. Mrs. Mason was too much excited to heed this. Taking
the little hand in hers, she led the child down-stairs, sweeping through
the hall like a sultana.</p>

<p>Mrs. Prior was struck with admiration at the splendor of her beauty, but
depressed by this display of magnificence for a wedding which was to be
strictly private. Her own refined taste revolted at the incongruity.
Indeed, Mrs. Mason herself seemed to feel something of this, for she
blushed even while giving her head a proud lift, and observed, in a low
voice:</p>

<p>"He would insist upon it. Nothing is rich enough to satisfy him."</p>

<p>Paul found Jube in his room when he entered it.</p>

<p>"Be ready," he said. "We shall soon know if it is the same man."</p>

<p>"But he may claim us, and say that I am his slave again," said Jube,
anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
"He will not see us. There, I hear the minister going down. Be ready.
Madame is coming to call us."</p>

<p>Mrs. Prior opened the door, and said: "Come," in a quick, nervous
whisper.</p>

<p>Paul and Jube followed her into the dining-room. A crimson curtain hung
over the sash which filled the upper part of the door. Mrs. Prior drew
it slightly inward, leaving a crevice on each side, through which Paul
and Jube could see all that went forward in the parlor without fear of
observation.</p>

<p>The couple who were to be married, sat out of range of the window, and
at first they only saw the minister saying something in a low voice to
Mrs. Prior. She went out and returned with the servant girl, who hung
shyly around the door, as if doubtful of the part she was called upon to
perform. Then there was a rustling of silk, a general movement, and Paul
saw the tyrant of his sea-life standing before the minister, with Mrs.
Mason's hand clasped in his. He saw more&mdash;for the Venetian blinds fell
apart, and a gleam of sunshine quivered across the gems upon the bride's
neck. A shudder passed over him, he clung to a neighboring chair for
support, and breathlessly looked on. Every word of that awful
ceremony&mdash;for it was awful to him&mdash;fell upon the boy's heart. When it
was ended, and the woman turned to the full light, a sick faintness
crept over him, and he fell into Jube's arms perfectly insensible. The
sight of his mother's necklace had overpowered the boy with terrible
memories.</p>

<a name="xlix" id="xlix"></a>CHAPTER XLIX.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">A PALACE READY FOR ITS MISTRESS.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the time of our story, New York Island was not so thickly crowded
with habitations as it is to-day. Men who lived on the outskirts of the
city could afford grounds more or less spacious about their habitations.
Gardens were no uncommon luxuries, and lawns not altogether unknown.
Just far enough from the city for retirement, yet sufficiently near for
easy access, stood a large mansion, which commanded a view of the
Hudson, and was surrounded by forest trees, which had doubtless
sheltered many an Indian encampment. Sloping lawns, flower gardens, and
rustic arbors lent glow and richness to every nook and vista of these
grounds. The house&mdash;a fine old family mansion&mdash;had been renovated and
altered so completely, since it had fallen into the hands of the present
proprietor, that the most intimate friend of the former owner must have
failed to recognize it.</p>

<p>The solid stone walls had been faced with marble. The small paned
windows had given place to broad plate glass, transparent as crystal.
Wreaths of rich sculpture broke the snow-white front around the doors
and windows, while heavy scrolls of marble rolled down the broad
entrance steps, and antique heads enriched the balconies. Two noble
lions, with slumbrous limbs and foamlike manes, crouched on the lower
entrance steps, and graceful vases, overflowing with rare and flowering
plants, stood on either hand by the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
The approach to this house was by a lodge gate, and along the sweep of a
gravelled carriage road, which held a beautiful flower-garden in its
curve. Every thing about the dwelling was in perfect order&mdash;not a leaf
disturbed the emerald richness of the grass, not a broken flower could
be found in all that luxuriant waste of blossoms. The English gardener
had done his work perfectly. There was not a footprint on the gravel
walk, nor a stain upon the whiteness of the marble. Pure, rich, and
beautiful, the house arose amid the bloom and shade of tall trees and
delicate flowers, like some snow-white palace in fairy-land.</p>

<p>Every thing was silent within this house. Servants moved about, it is
true; but they were too well trained for any thing like confusion, and a
state of expectation kept them unusually quiet. The housekeeper went
from room to room, anxious that nothing should be out of place, and a
little nervous in her desire to please a mistress whom she had never
seen.</p>

<p>The truth is, that the household was in a state of more general
ignorance regarding the persons they were hired to serve than usually
falls to people of their class; but what was more remarkable, they knew
as much, and more of their master than any of the neighbors, with whom
he was an object of no little curiosity.</p>

<p>Mr. Nelson had come upon the neighborhood suddenly, whether from the
east, west, north or south, no one could pretend to say. Of course there
was a great deal of conjecture. A man of vast wealth and liberal
education he certainly was; fine looking too, after a peculiar style.
Besides this, he appeared quite young enough to be considered a
desirable match for the most fastidious belle in any one of the hundred
and fifty circles that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span> dispute the palm of aristocracy year by year,
without settling the question among themselves.</p>

<p>He had bought the old mansion house, paid for it in cash, and taken up
his residence in one wing, while the alterations we have spoken of were
going on. As a bachelor his habits were very simple and his words few.</p>

<p>The best artisans were employed, and the most expensive books on
gardening and architecture lay upon the table in his room. He studied
these books night and day, for some weeks before the persons necessary
to his work were called around him. When they came at last, he was
prepared not only to take specifications, but to suggest them, and that
with an air of knowledge that won profound respect from the persons with
whom he conversed.</p>

<p>It was impossible to tell, by this man's manners or conversation, what
his business in life had been. He was always on his guard against the
intrusiveness of curiosity, always gentle, or rather stolidly quiet; but
once or twice, when a man conceited in his art had ventured to
contradict him, the frown upon his forehead had proved an ominous
warning which no one cared to provoke a second time.</p>

<p>During some months he had lived entirely at the old mansion, watching
its gradual transfiguration and superintending the changes with untiring
assiduity. Two or three times he had been absent for several days, but
no one knew where, and he gave no notice either of his intended
departure or return.</p>



<hr />

<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
<a name="l" id="l"></a>CHAPTER L.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">COMING HOME OF THE BRIDE.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> last, when every thing was complete, and the place stood out a
paradise in comparison with the most beautiful residences of the city,
circumstances arose that inflamed anew the curiosity of the household.
The entrance was haunted by tradespeople, bringing packages that could
only prove useful to a lady. All this was a fitting preparation for the
very quiet orders which Mr. Nelson gave to his housekeeper, just as he
stepped into his carriage one morning.</p>

<p>"Have every thing in readiness, Mrs. Ford," he said, "for on the third
day from this I shall bring my wife home."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ford was a nice old English housekeeper, brought up with profound
reverence for her employers, and early taught the useful lesson of
minding her own business, one of the most valuable secrets known to
society. Had this been otherwise she could have commanded no time for
asking questions, for while making this announcement, Mr. Nelson stepped
into the carriage, and drove off without vouchsafing another word.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ford went back to the quiet performance of her duties, wondering a
little what kind of a person this new mistress would prove, and doubtful
whether it was a bride or a wife of long standing, whom she would be
called upon to obey.</p>

<p>The appointed days passed by, and the whole household, as I have said,
was in a state of expectation. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span> low hum came up from the city, as if a
vast hive of bees were swarming, but the sound was so distant and faint,
that it rather deepened the quiet of the place. All at once the noise of
wheels inside the lodge gate sounded distinct, and grew stronger, till a
carriage, from which a lady looked forth with every appearance of keen
interest, swept up to the front entrance.</p>

<p>Mr. Nelson stepped out of the carriage, looking almost nervously
anxious.</p>

<p>"This is our home, Ellen. Tell me that you like it, and will be happy
here," said the master of the mansion, holding her hand tightly as they
stood on the lower step together.</p>

<p>The lady lifted her eyes to the beautiful <i>facade</i>, and for the moment
seemed overpowered by its great beauty.</p>

<p>"Why, Nelson, this is a palace," she said, while a glow of triumphant
vanity spread over her face.</p>

<p>"To what else should I bring my queen?" he answered, bending his flushed
face toward her and speaking in a voice that thrilled with passionate
tenderness. "Oh, Ellen, my wife, if you desired the stars of heaven I
would strive to reach them for you."</p>

<p>"How very, very beautiful it is!" she exclaimed, gazing around with
triumph beaming in her face, utterly ignoring his passionate outburst.
"I have dreamed of such places, but never saw them. Nelson, we shall
live like princes here!"</p>

<p>"Princes are not always happy," he said, smiling upon her in a way that
only a naturally grave man ever smiles. "But we, Ellen, we will let
neither discord or care come near us. If gold can hedge us in we will
heap walls so high that nothing but love can reach us."</p>

<p>"Ah, these are not dreams," she said, drawing a deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span> breath. "The man
who has power enough to create a palace like this, makes no false boast
when he talks of golden walls."</p>

<p>She stood a moment, drinking in the scene with greedy admiration. Then,
for the first time that day, she turned her eyes full upon Nelson's
face, and smiled upon him.</p>

<p>"You are pleased, my wife."</p>

<p>"I am delighted, Nelson."</p>

<p>"Nelson! when I call you wife?" he said, with reproachful tenderness.</p>

<p>"Well, husband."</p>

<p>As the word left her lips an unaccountable pallor spread over both their
faces. Instead of the happiness he expected, the husband of two days
felt a pang so heavy that it made him shrink; and the woman&mdash;she had
uttered the word before, and under different surroundings!</p>

<p>With a sudden and heavy cloud upon them these persons turned from each
other without speaking, and mounted the steps.</p>

<p>To have seen Mrs. Nelson passing along the tressellated floor of the
vestibule, where the servants were gathered to receive her, you would
have believed that she had trod on Gobelin carpets all her life. The
good housekeeper, who had dwelt in the atmosphere of nobility from her
cradle up, was absolutely struck dumb by the queenliness of her
presence, and thought in her heart that the new mistress must have come
from abroad, or at least have been educated there.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nelson saw the impression she had made, and this gave graciousness
to her presence which completely subdued the group of dependants into
admiration. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span> said a few patronizing words to each, and passing
through the vestibule, entered upon her new life with a degree of
graceful self-possession which astonished even her husband.</p>

<p>And now commenced a career such as few persons ever carried out so
triumphantly. Mrs. Nelson had wealth, unbounded beauty, education quite
sufficient for the demands of fashion, and a craving ambition for
notoriety, which was sure to make its way. Gold, in America, proves a
sure road to this kind of distinction, and the great lever of republican
society was used without stint or measure in this singular household.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nelson had seized on the insinuation, half put as a question by the
housekeeper, regarding her foreign appearance, and accepted it as a
truth&mdash;nay, more&mdash;so absorbing was her vanity that she allowed it to be
understood that the great wealth which astonished everybody came into
Mr. Nelson's hands through her own munificent affection; an idea that
Mr. Nelson rather encouraged by his silence and entire submission to her
will in all things.</p>

<p>It was not many months before the beautiful Mrs. Nelson became a star of
magnitude in the fashionable circles of New York. Of course she was an
object of great interest; when curious persons inquired about her
origin, they were answered that she was an American by birth, but had
spent most of her life abroad with her first husband, who had left her a
young and beautiful widow with enormous wealth. This wealth she had
bestowed on Mr. Nelson, who, after travelling all over the world, had
fallen in love with her at first sight, and still regarded her with a
sort of adoration, as everybody could see.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
If there was any thing hollow or false in all this, the most intimate
person in that magnificent household never could find the proof. True,
Mr. Nelson was not a gay or particularly cheerful husband, but that
might be said of a thousand other men with dashing wives; it was, after
all, a matter of constitution only. Certainly the lady was altogether
the most popular of the two. The material style of her beauty was of
that sumptuous order which wealth embellishes to its greatest
perfection. She was witty, gay, and for all the superficial uses of
society, a fascinating woman, whom the most ultra among the fashionable,
were glad to recognize as a leader. Thus, unlimited control of wealth,
and unflinching assurance, placed the widow Mason, in a few short
months, in the very heart of our Metropolitan society.</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="li" id="li"></a>CHAPTER LI.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">THE DAY BEFORE TRIAL.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is no unendurable sorrow which is not the outgrowth of some sin. A
peaceful conscience cannot be rendered altogether miserable, place it
where you will. You would not have suspected that the fair young
creature who sat within those prison bars from morning till night, when
her misery was lost in the darkness, had been charged with the dread
crime of murder. Indeed, a person with quick sensibilities might have
regarded her rather as some gentle martyr, waiting to seal her faith by
sublime suffering, for a more heavenly face than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span> hers never appeared
behind the rusted gratings of a dungeon.</p>

<p>Up to this time, Katharine had been a bright and very beautiful girl;
such graces as youth, bloom, and cheerfulness give, she had possessed in
perfection, but she was something more now. The roses had died on her
cheeks, but a pure whiteness rested there, more lovely by far. The
dimples had faded from the corners of her mouth, but an expression of
holy sweetness was left behind, that sometimes deepened to a smile when
any one spoke to her with unusual kindness. But her eyes&mdash;those who have
seen the original Beatrice Cenci, where it hangs an embodied sorrow in
that old Roman palace, would ask no farther description of the look
which slept forever in the deep blue orbs of the American girl; there
was, indeed, a difference to be felt rather than portrayed. Through all
the exquisite sadness in those eyes, a terrible remembrance sleeps,
which leads you to forgive, but not altogether acquit, the Cenci. But
with Katharine nothing but sublime innocence lay beneath the sorrow. The
expression of the living eyes was mournful as those of the immortal
picture, but you looked upon them with less pain.</p>

<p>Thus in the twilight of her prison she sat reading the family Bible,
which had been brought to that place by her mother. It was an old book,
worn with much handling, the paper yellow with age, and the leathern
cover broke at the corners. Since Katharine's remembrance, this Bible
had occupied the round candle stand by her mother's bed. When that
singular woman first entered the prison, after giving up her home, she
laid this most precious of her treasures upon the young girl's lap,
without speaking a word. Katharine knew what this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span> act imported, and
bowed her fair head in thankfulness, for she sorely lacked the comfort
those holy pages might bring.</p>

<p>Katharine had never been a great reader, but her intellect was clear,
and her heart, rendered earnest by suffering, seized upon the solemn
truths of that book as a flower absorbs the air and sunshine, until she
grew strong beneath their lessons.</p>

<p>Not long after that Bible was laid in her lap, much of the horrible
dread of death went out from her soul. In its holy pages she found how
tranquilly innocence could die, how trustfully it could repose in the
hands of God, and from that day the sublime beauty that I have mentioned
dawned on her face.</p>

<p>Thus, as I said awhile ago, Katharine sat in her prison, reading. The
Bible lay open on her lap; but while her eyelids drooped, and their
lashes shaded those deep blue orbs, they were tinged with the depths of
their color, as violets cast purple shadows where the sun touches them.
The golden tresses of her hair, embraided around her head, scintillated
the sunbeams that fell through her prison bars like a glory. Her dress
was white dimity, a fabric much worn in those days, which fell heavily
around her like the marble drapery of a statue. Thus she was surrounded
with a whiteness which threw her figure out in strong relief from a
background of shadows gathering on the walls of her dungeon.</p>

<p>As the last sunbeam left the heavy bars that rusted across the window,
she lifted her eyes and waited, with one hand&mdash;alas! snow-white from
confinement&mdash;resting upon the open page. A footstep near the door, and
the jingle of keys, had disturbed her. She looked earnestly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span> toward the
noise until the door opened. Then the expression of her face grew
animated. She laid the Bible down upon her bed, and moved forward with
both hands extended.</p>

<p>"You have come; ah, I knew it; when did you break a promise."</p>

<p>The old man who entered took her hand softly between his two hard palms,
and glancing at the open Bible, said:</p>

<p>"You were well employed, child; I can bring you no better company than
that."</p>

<p>Katharine looked back upon the Bible, smiling faintly, the only way she
ever smiled in those days.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," she said; "but you look pale, have you brought news for
me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," said old Mrs. Thrasher, coming forward and kissing the
prisoner, "he brings news, but keep a good heart. God is above all."</p>

<p>Katharine bent her head an instant and stood before them in silence,
then she looked gravely up and said:</p>

<p>"Is it to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Yes, Katharine, it is to-morrow; are you ready?" answered the old man.</p>

<p>"Yes, father, I am ready."</p>

<p>Her voice was low, but clear as the fall of water-drops.</p>

<p>"I am ready to live or to die as God shall will it. Our Lord has told me
how to do both."</p>

<p>"Blessed be his holy name!" broke forth the old man.</p>

<p>"Amen," whispered the gentle woman by his side.</p>

<p>Katharine clasped her hands and lifted her eyes upward, while her lips
moved silently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
"We have good counsel; every thing has been done that lies within mortal
power," said Mr. Thrasher.</p>

<p>"I know it. The lawyers were here questioning me. They told me it might
be soon, but to-morrow&mdash;that is sudden."</p>

<p>"But it will be over in a little while," said Mrs. Thrasher, anxious to
throw in her mite of consolation.</p>

<p>"Yes, it will be over, and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Katharine's voice trembled. She was so young, poor thing, and sometimes
her timid nature fell away from the faith that gave it strength, and
shuddered at the death before her.</p>

<p>"Then and now we must put our faith in Him," answered the old man, with
tender solemnity.</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;I do, father!"</p>

<p>There was something very sweet in the way she uttered this little word
"father." Indeed, Katharine had been brought to trust in the old man so
thoroughly that she followed him as a lamb keeps by the side of its
shepherd. But for his mild, firm teachings, the poor child must have
fallen under the burden of her misfortunes, and the sorrow of her young
life might have taken a different course.</p>

<p>"What is sorrow, what is death itself, compared to the pangs of guilt,
my child?"</p>

<p>"I know, father, but death seems terrible to me sometimes when I am
alone here in the night."</p>

<p>Mrs. Thrasher began to sob and Mrs. Allen looked down upon her child in
pale grief.</p>

<p>"Ah, why cannot I, who am old, and used to trouble, take her place," she
said, drearily.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, I want courage. At first, when they left me, I was a
coward, but it is not so of late, at least not often. Something here
grows stronger every day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
The girl laid one hand on her heart, while a soft glow came to her face.</p>

<p>"And that is faith," said Mr. Thrasher.</p>

<p>"It seems like a living presence; as if my babe had turned to an angel,
and were folding its wings here. How can any one think I killed it&mdash;I
who gloried so in being its mother."</p>

<p>"We know that you never harmed it," said Mrs. Allen. "That is one
comfort, my child."</p>

<p>"No, no; we never thought it, neither your father nor your two mothers,"
said Mrs. Thrasher, planting herself by Mrs. Allen's side; thus
suggesting her own right to be considered.</p>

<p>"It is strange," said Katharine, thoughtfully, "very strange that any
one can believe such things of a poor girl. I am sure no woman in the
world ever got this idea of herself."</p>

<p>"No woman would have the heart to think it," muttered Mrs. Thrasher;
"but the law, that is stern and cruel enough for any thing."</p>

<p>"To-morrow it will prove cruel with me, I am sure," said Katharine;
"when they took me away from home the little children looked after me as
if there was blood on my clothes. It made my heart ache to see their
frightened faces at the windows as the wagon went by. If children can
judge one so harshly, what will a court full of stern men do."</p>

<p>"The men who look so stern are sometimes very kind at heart," said Mr.
Thrasher.</p>

<p>Katharine lifted her eyes to his face.</p>

<p>"You will be there, father, and you&mdash;and you, my mothers?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Katharine, we will be there," said both the women at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
"And a greater than they will be there, Katharine," added the old man,
solemnly, and resting one hand on her head a moment, he turned away.</p>

<p>The two women saw that his lip quivered as he passed through the door,
but to Katharine he was an embodiment of sublime strength, and it took
away half her courage when his shadow disappeared from the threshold of
her prison. Alas, she was nothing but a girl, timid from want of
experience, and greatly dependent for strength on those she loved. When
Katharine Allen was left alone she began to realize that the day of her
great trouble was near at hand. A faintness like that of death itself
crept over her, and she sat down in the midst of her dungeon chamber,
sinking down upon the floor in a wild, dreary way, that would have
brought tears to the eyes of her worst enemy.</p>

<p>By many an anxious question she had won from the
<a name="jailor" id="jailor"></a><ins title="Original has jailer">jailor</ins> a
general knowledge of the forms which attend a criminal trial. She knew
that crowds of curious people, perhaps coarse-hearted people, would
jostle her on the way to prison&mdash;that scores on scores of eyes would
follow her with hate and loathing. She saw the band of jurors grasping
her life in their will, listening with heavy countenances to the
evidence of a crime that was not hers, but of which it seemed impossible
that any human tribunal could absolve her.</p>

<p>Then, going to and from the trial, little children would look up at her
as they had done when she passed the red school-house at Shrub Oak, some
with timid pity, others with coarse amazement, and others still ready to
break forth into hoots and sneers, as if some abhorrent animal had
crossed their path. These thoughts were hard to endure. She had so
dearly loved little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span> children, and turned so naturally for affection
toward all living things, that the edict of hate, though undeserved,
made her shrink with absolute pain.</p>

<p>She took up her Bible and tried to read, but the letters ran together on
the page, harassing her sight, but giving back no sense. Thus the
evening found her going out into blank space till the darkness crept
through her prison bars and fell over her like a pall.</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="lii" id="lii"></a>CHAPTER LII.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">THE STREETS AND THE COURT HOUSE.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day found a crowd around the court house, hours before the time
for opening&mdash;an eager-eyed, jostling throng, to whom a trial for life
was sure to bring keen excitement of some kind. In a Puritan State,
where places of amusement are seldom found, any thing calculated to
excite public curiosity is an event which makes the most painful
occasions a sort of holiday for the populace. The horrible fascination
which a trial like that always possesses for the human mind was added to
other feelings with which the people of that day frequented the courts
of justice, and any trial which had a tragic interest for the people,
drew crowds around the court house, full of eager curiosity, and
sometimes almost ferocious excitement&mdash;crowds which watched the progress
of events like men enthralled by the horror of a terrible play.</p>

<p>The events which caused the arrest of Katharine Allen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span> had been a
favorite theme of conversation for months. Public excitement was at its
highest pitch; and, when the day of her trial came, a stranger, passing
through the streets, might have believed that some event was transpiring
in which the highest interests of the whole community were at stake.</p>

<p>A crowd gathered about the old jail, which loomed up in the midst of the
town&mdash;a dark monument of human sorrow and human crime. A moving throng
was in every street which led from thence to the court house&mdash;men,
women, and little children, brought out as for a holiday show, all
waiting, breathless and eager, for the appearance of the poor girl they
were ready to hunt to an ignominious death.</p>

<p>Now and then you passed a face that looked grave or sad, as if the moral
lesson of that trial was felt, and not without sympathy for the poor
young creature who was to be its object.</p>

<p>The crowd had been waiting for hours, and so singularly organized is
this miserable human nature of ours, so dependent are our feelings upon
the position in which we are placed, so completely do our sympathies
waver to and fro, according to our particular situation, that it was
noticeable, as time wore on, that murmurs grew harsher and more sullen.
The hard faces grew harder; even those which had expressed something
akin to pity lost their softness, and wherever a knot of such women as
love scenes of this kind were gathered, execrations and complaints
against the criminal were the most severe and cruel.</p>

<p>At last there was a little bustle in the jail yard; the crowd responded
by eager murmurs. Slowly the heavy gates swung open; a simultaneous rush
was made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span> toward them, and it required all the efforts of the armed
constables to force back the eager mob.</p>

<p>At length, a passage was made down the street, and the crowd pushed back
on either side. Then slowly, with a dull, ominous sound, a wagon, drawn
by a single horse, rolled out of the jail yard and took its way through
the street.</p>

<p>In this wagon, with an officer upon either side, sat Katharine Allen.</p>

<p>She was deadly pale, her sunny hair, too bright for a scene like that,
was brushed smoothly back under her bonnet; a large shawl was thrown
over her white dress, and she sat between her guards so still and silent
that she hardly seemed conscious of her position, or terrified by the
danger which gathered closer and closer about her.</p>

<p>A new murmur of pity went up from the people who thronged the sidewalks.
In her statue-like quiet, the girl looked so young and fair, it appeared
incredible that she could have been guilty of the crime with which she
was charged.</p>

<p>At that sound, Katharine raised her head quickly, her great eyes
wandered to and fro, hopeless, helpless, a vivid crimson swept over her
whole countenance, then it faded almost as quickly as it came, leaving
the features paler than before. With a low moan, the poor young creature
closed her eyes, her lips moved tremulously. Amid all the terror of that
scene&mdash;with judgment and death so near&mdash;a calm, such as she had not
before felt, settled down upon her soul.</p>

<p>I do believe that in that hour of supreme agony, God sent His angels to
whisper comfort and peace. By no human law could one have accounted for
the change which came over her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
On through the street passed the little cortege, the constables marching
in front, and pushing aside the people, who, faithful to their New
England instincts, yielded almost ungrumblingly to the dictates of those
armed with the power they so reverenced&mdash;that of the law.</p>

<p>Katharine did not look up again; the deathly pallor had left her face;
but around the lips, which still moved at intervals, a smile had settled
like a ray of sunlight.</p>

<p>It was a glorious morning; the sun lay golden and warm upon the town; it
fell caressingly upon the girl in the prison wagon, revealing her
broadly to the rude gaze of those curious eyes.</p>

<p>As they approached the court house, the crowd grew denser. The wagon
moved more and more slowly, and the people grew keenly eager, as if
curiosity and interest had reached a climax when the victim was about
disappearing from their sight.</p>

<p>The court room was a bare, gloomy apartment, where every thing seemed to
deepen the usual horror connected with such a place&mdash;a dark chamber
where the shadows never wholly dispersed. No matter how brightly the sun
shone without, the golden radiance broke against the window panes, as if
frightened by the appearance of the place, and in passing through the
dusty windows, seemed to lose all brilliancy and warmth.</p>

<p>On that day it was packed with a dense crowd, all waiting eagerly for
the entrance of the girl whose conviction they had come to witness.</p>

<p>Every one was there&mdash;the judge upon his bench, cold and silent as a
marble image of justice; the jury in their box, and, a little way off,
the witnesses.</p>

<p>Mrs. Allen sat by the side of old Mr. Thrasher; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span> had taken her hand,
meaning to speak some last word of consolation, but the agony in her
eyes froze the words upon his lips; he could only hold fast to that
withered hand, which in her anguish she wrenched away from him,
impatient even of sympathy.</p>

<p>The dead silence of the court room was broken by a dull murmur from
without, through which the rattle of the wagon wheels was distinctly
audible.</p>

<p>A sound upon the stairs&mdash;the tread of heavy feet, and the door swung
slowly upon its hinges. A shiver ran through Mrs. Allen's frame; she
sank heavily back, moaning. She knew that her child had been brought in;
she heard the bustle with which they placed her in the criminal's seat,
but when she tried to raise her eyes it seemed as if the lids had turned
to iron.</p>

<p>When silence was again restored she made one violent effort and looked
up. Katharine was sitting still and white in her place of shame. The
mother half rose, with a vague impulse to rush forward and save her
child. That moment Katharine lifted her heavy eyes, and met that longing
gaze&mdash;unconsciously she extended her arms.</p>

<p>"Mother! oh, mother!"</p>

<p>The words died on those white lips in a moan so faint that it failed to
reach the most eager listener. Then the stern old woman leaned heavily
back in her seat, and fainted away so quietly that no human soul was
aware of it.</p>

<br />
<span class="sub">THE DOCTOR'S EVIDENCE.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Out</span> upon the steps of the court house were a couple of men who had been
Mrs. Allen's neighbors, and had known Katharine from childhood. There
they stood, unable to gain entrance to the court&mdash;talking one to the
other in subdued voices.</p>

<p>At last, a man from the same neighborhood forced his way through the
crowd upon the stairs and hurried up to the spot where they stood.</p>

<p>The men turned toward him with eager questions, while he wiped his face
with a huge silk pocket handkerchief, breathing hard, like a man who had
been engaged in some painful struggle.</p>

<p>"How do they get on, Mr. Amos?" asked one of the men.</p>

<p>"They've just had her mother up," he answered, in a low voice. "I
couldn't stand it a minit longer&mdash;I felt as if I was choking to death."</p>

<p>"What did she say?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it wasn't that. She went toward the stand quiet enough, but just as
they held the Bible out to her she looked up at Katharine, and begun to
shake so that one of the constables had to take hold of her."</p>

<p>"What did the girl do?"</p>

<p>"She kind o' raised herself and looked at her mother. I can't tell you
what it was like. I've seen a lamb look like it when the knife was at
its throat. The old woman tried to stand up firm, but when she saw that
poor cretur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span> she just laid her head down on the railing and begun
shaking and sobbing like every thing, but she didn't shed a single tear.
When she lifted her head again, Katharine looked at her and smiled. She
did actually, but it was enough to break a man's heart. I'd rather a
seen her cry right out a thousand times."</p>

<p>The farmer paused here, took out his silk handkerchief again, and turned
his face away.</p>

<p>"Poor gal," muttered one of his listeners; "it seems as if it was only
yesterday I see her dancing about like a little poppet, with her curls
hanging down her shoulders. I can't believe she did it, I can't, in
spite of every thing; 'taint in natur."</p>

<p>"What's that they are saying?" cried one of the group. "The doctor's
called up; I want to hear his evidence. Come, let's try and crowd in."</p>

<p>The two men joined forces, and elbowed their way into the court room
again, not unfriendly to the poor girl, as our readers have seen, but
resolved against losing a single feature of the scene they had come ten
miles to witness.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, the doctor whose name had been called. He was enrolled
among the witnesses of the prosecution; but those who knew that
eccentric, but really great man, had an idea that, in attempting to
criminate the poor girl by that witness, the law would find its match.
The lawyers themselves partook somewhat of this feeling, and rather
shrunk from the keen sarcasm and sly wit with which he was likely to
retort upon any professional encroachment. As for his old neighbors, the
doctor's evidence was a point in the trial which engaged their keenest
interest. They held a sort of property right in the doctor's reputation
for curt eccentricity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span> and were anxious to pit him against the lawyers
in the most striking manner before the assembled wisdom of all
Connecticut.</p>

<p>Thus, hundreds of faces, familiar about Bungy, Falls Hill, and
Chewstown, brightened eagerly when the doctor's name was called out, and
murmurs ran through the crowd that now those city lawyers would find
their match. No mistake about it!</p>

<p>The doctor, who had been sitting in a corner of the court room, watching
the proceedings with vigilant attention, heard his name called, and
arose. You would hardly have known the man, as he made a slow progress
toward the witness stand. The usual quaint smile had left his lips, and
his eyes, always full of droll or sarcastic humor, were bright with the
dignity of an earnest purpose. He stood upon the witness stand, leaning
heavily on his crutches; but, notwithstanding this disadvantage, a
dignity was imparted to his presence that no one could resist&mdash;you would
not have believed that a droll saying had ever passed those lips.</p>

<p>The prisoner leaned forward, clasped her hands, and pressing them
heavily on her lap, looked at him in wild dismay. The change in all his
features struck her with terror; it seemed as if he had suddenly turned
her enemy.</p>

<p>The doctor observed this wild astonishment, and his face softened a
little; nay, those stern features began to quiver, and he was obliged to
look down a moment to recover himself.</p>

<p>"May it please the Court," he said at length, motioning the person away
who came forward to administer the oath. "I am a physician, and bound by
a professional oath not to reveal the secrets of my patient. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span> am not
sure that any knowledge which I have would bear against this poor girl,
and from the depths of my heart I believe her innocent, but I ask to be
excused from bearing evidence in the case."</p>

<p>There was a moment's consultation among the counsel. That for the
prosecution sprung up as if there had been high treason in the doctor's
speech, and insisted that no distinctions should be made in his favor. A
great crime had been committed against the Commonwealth, an unnatural
crime, and the ends of justice demanded that every means should be used
for obtaining the truth. The judge yielded to, or rather sustained his
argument, and the doctor was courteously desired to take the oath.</p>

<p>A gleam in the doctor's eye, and a keen glance at the prosecuting
attorney, prepared his friends for a sharp encounter of wits, but he was
a man to rise steadily with the occasion. Terrible interests were at
stake here, and his true character rose out of its eccentricity. He took
the oath reverently, and stated the facts already known to the reader,
in a clear, impressive manner that told greatly upon the jury, but
sheltering himself within the strict limits of the law, he volunteered
nothing, neither did he shrink from any question propounded to him; all
this struck his friends with a sort of awe. They were profoundly
impressed by the dignity of his course, but a little disappointed,
nevertheless. Once the doctor turned and looked anxiously on the
prisoner. It was when the lawyer asked if Katharine had exhibited any
anxiety to conceal the birth of her child from the neighbors&mdash;if, in
fact, she had not requested the doctor to keep it a secret.</p>

<p>The doctor hesitated, moved uneasily, and half wheeled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span> around, as if
determined to leave the witness stand, for he knew what effect his
answer would have.</p>

<p>Katharine leaned more decidedly toward him, and while the court was
hushed under a general anxiety to hear his reply, her sweet, clear voice
penetrated through the silence.</p>

<p>"Speak, doctor; I did ask you not to tell&mdash;I was afraid of what they
would think."</p>

<p>The officer stepped forward to enforce silence, and the prisoner shrunk
back affrighted.</p>

<p>Now the doctor's stern lip began to quiver, and his keen eyes flashed
sharp as steel through the tears that shot into them, for the first
time, perhaps, since his manhood.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "if you will force me to it&mdash;she did make this request;
but it was only for a little delay. The poor child wished her secret
kept till some one should return."</p>

<p>"And who was that person?"</p>

<p>Katharine's lips parted, and she held her breath with keen interest till
the answer was given.</p>

<p>"I do not know."</p>

<p>"And she never told you?"</p>

<p>"She never did."</p>

<p>"And you have no suspicion who this person was?"</p>

<p>"Suspicion is not evidence. I have no knowledge."</p>

<p>The questions now took a professional turn, and the doctor's evidence
bore strongly in favor of the prisoner. His deep knowledge, and clear
elucidation of medical theories bearing on the case, made a deep
<a name="impression" id="impression"></a><ins title="Original has impresssion">impression</ins> upon the jury, and threw out gleams of light
that were adopted with avidity by the defence.</p>

<p>Indeed, the doctor, acting himself under a clear conviction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span> of the
prisoner's innocence, contributed more than any other person in
fastening the same idea upon the court. But one terrible fact remained
immovable&mdash;the burial of the child. The apparent forethought by which
this had been accomplished. The time seized upon during the absence of
the mother. What eloquence could sweep these fatal truths from the case?
None, none!</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="liv" id="liv"></a>CHAPTER LIV.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">THE VERDICT.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> more Mrs. Allen was put upon the stand to undergo the questions
which had been so fruitless with the doctor. It was this point of the
case alone which struck terror to the prisoner. When a question was
asked which apparently threatened to drag her husband's name through
that tortuous investigation, her lips would blanch and her eyes fill
with sharp anxiety. Thus her face gleamed out white and ghastly when
Mrs. Allen was put under the torture of new questions. The mother looked
at her gravely, and turned to the judge; but when the attorney proceeded
with his interrogations, she answered simply:</p>

<p>"I am her mother. Let me go."</p>

<p>They did let her go. The attorney had no heart to press that pale,
tortured woman farther, and became generous, partly from humanity,
partly because there was something in the face of his witness which
warned him that nothing short of death would force her to speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
Unfortunately he had evidence enough, and could afford to take this poor
mother from the rack of his questions.</p>

<p>When this danger was over, the prisoner fell back into her previous
state of gentle resignation. So long as her husband's reputation was
safe, so long as his name was kept out of the proceedings, she had no
feeling of resistance.</p>

<p>The business of the court went on. All the details of that strange death
and burial, so far as known evidence could give them, were laid before
the court. The prisoner heard them like one in a dream. Once or twice
she lifted those mournful eyes as some detail struck suddenly on her
remembrance; but the connecting links being deficient in her mind,
baffled its consciousness. Then a change came upon the court. The
witness stand was empty, and a tall, hard-faced man stood before the
judge, pledging himself to prove her guilt. Katharine heard him with a
sort of dreary amazement. How sturdily he denounced her. How bitter were
his words. How cruelly sharp those dark eyes as they turned from the
jury to her face. Poor thing, it seemed very cruel. What had she done
that a strong man should hunt her to death with his words.</p>

<p>Then another man arose. She knew him, for he had visited her in prison.
The look which he cast upon her was full of compassion. He pleaded for
her like one inspired. His face was pale with emotion&mdash;his voice
faltered and his eyes filled when he turned to make a last appeal to the
twelve men who held her life in their hands. In the midst of this
appeal, Katharine came out of her dream and began to weep from self
pity. Her sufferings all rose vividly before her, but it seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span> another
person she was pitying, not herself. She met the softened glances turned
toward the place where she sat with tender sympathy, as if they were all
deploring the misery of some third person. Thus, a faint glow shone out
from the pallor of her face, which deepened the sentiment in her behalf.</p>

<p>Then the judge arose with his face to the jury. His voice was slow and
grave, his countenance sad. She could not comprehend him. He was neither
stern like her enemy, nor pathetic like her friend. Still, under his
seriousness she felt that some pity for her youth existed. When he sat
down she gave him a long, sorrowful look, which he broke by lifting one
hand to his face as if those eyes troubled him.</p>

<p>The twelve men arose and went out, one after another, like mourners at a
funeral. Then a murmur ran through the court, and suppressed whispers
went from lip to lip. She knew that these men held her life, but could
not realize that their fiat was so near. Time went by. It might have
been minutes, it might have been hours, for aught she knew, since those
men had left their seats empty. The court was still thronged. The judge
sat in his arm-chair, shrouding his face with one hand.</p>

<p>A faint bustle. The twelve men glided into their old places, and a
voice, deep, solemn, and stern, spoke out:</p>

<p>"Prisoner, look upon the jury&mdash;jury, look upon the prisoner."</p>

<p>Katharine stood up. Those twelve men met her mournful gaze with
shrinking glances.</p>

<p>"Guilty, or not guilty?"</p>

<p>"Guilty! But not of murder in the first degree. Not guilty unto death!"</p>

<p>There was a hushed tumult in the crowd. Those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span> looked upon her face
rejoiced that she was saved the last penalty. Some muttered bitterly
against the verdict, and grew indignant with the jury for depriving them
of a death spectacle; and a few said, in their hearts, this verdict is
unjust&mdash;that young creature is innocent.</p>

<p>Katharine sat down; a band, hard and firm as iron, that had seemed
tightening around her heart all the day, broke, and flooded her being
with tears. Poor, poor child! she had been so afraid to die. Amid all
her heroism, there was a perpetual dread, which made her gentle nature
shrink from the horror before her. Besides, death would take her away
from <i>him</i>, perhaps, forever and ever. This thought had been the most
cruel of all. But it was over now. They would not take her life&mdash;she
might see him again&mdash;he would love her all the better for having
shielded his name from this trouble and disgrace; at any rate, she would
not die, she would not die.</p>

<p>Overwhelmed with these feelings, she heard nothing that was going on in
the court, but sat with her hands clasped and quivering in her lap,
while the tears fell, drop by drop, down her cheeks, whispering:</p>

<p>"I live! I live! and shall see him again!"</p>

<p>A voice called forth her name, commanding her to stand up and hear the
sentence of the court.</p>

<p>She arose, supporting herself by the railing, for the last few moments
had left her very weak. Her eyes were full of tears. She saw the judge
through a mist, and his words sounded from a great distance.</p>

<p>"Condemned to sit upon a gallows, erected on the public common of New
Haven, for one hour, with a halter around your neck; and, after that, to
be confined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span> in the State's Prison, at Simsbury Mines, during eight
years."</p>

<p>She heard words of kindly encouragement and entreaty to use the mercy
extended by the court as a means of repentance. Her great sin, unnatural
cruelty. Time for reformation&mdash;fragments like these floated by her, but
they left no impression. She only comprehended one thing&mdash;they had given
her life! life! life! life!</p>

<p>She sunk on her knees as the judge ceased, buried her face on the
criminal's seat&mdash;and thanked God that he had permitted her to live. The
old widow had sat through it all quiet&mdash;as great suffering most
frequently is&mdash;pale as death, but with a certain stern fortitude which a
Spartan mother might have felt without shame. When the jury came in she
arose with slow unconsciousness, and stood upright in the presence of
the court, her gray eyes heavy with anguish, her white lips parted in an
agony of suspense. Guilty, but not unto death. She lifted her clasped
hands feebly upward, and fell back, sobbing like a little child.</p>

<h2><a name="lv" id="lv"></a>CHAPTER LV.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">THE TRAIL OF THE SERPENT.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">No</span> more brilliant house than that of Mrs. Nelson could be found in the
city of New York. This woman had flashed upon society like a meteor. Her
dress&mdash;her style so original that they were taken to be foreign. Her
quick wit and sumptuous beauty won hosts of admirers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span> Her carriage was
the most splendid and nobly appointed of any that appeared in the
fashionable thoroughfares. Every thing rich and unique that a prodigal
taste could imagine or money obtain, was to be found in her home. All
the costly adornments which her husband had prepared for her, with so
much solicitude, were crowded into side rooms and entrance halls, while
she filled the principal apartments after a fancy entirely her own. The
great joy of her life was in spending money, and in parading the result
before the world. To defy emulation and excite envy was her crowning
desire. Yet, with all this prodigality, she was never generous, never
felt the sweet impulses of charity, or knew the gentle bliss of
self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>It sometimes, nay, often happens, that those who rise from poverty to
sudden wealth, are more hard-hearted than persons born to affluence.
This may arise from a reluctance to review painful or humiliating
associations; or it may be that, with some characters, poverty has a
hardening process, and, when lifted above it, they feel a sort of
pleasure in seeing others suffer as they have done. This is a bad phase
of human nature&mdash;but who can say that it seldom presents itself in
society.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nelson was one of these women. She would not, knowingly, have
perpetrated a crime, or done a palpable injustice; but her whole life
was made up of trivial vanity and intense selfishness. What little
feeling she possessed, had been sacrificed to a craving desire for
wealth, and she bent all her faculties to one end, that of securing all
its privileges and enjoyments to herself.</p>

<p>It was not long before her husband became convinced of this; for real
and deep passion rendered him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span> keen sighted. His character, naturally
stern and silent, grew bitter under this one thought; but the fatal love
which had led him to lavish so much upon her, still imprisoned his heart
as the serpents of the laocoon coil around their victims.</p>

<p>A few months of married life, and this was the condition in which the
Nelsons found themselves. He a lonely, sullen slave&mdash;she reckless and
egotistical, at the best&mdash;sometimes insolent in her exactions, and
always ungrateful. But this did not impair her popularity, or, in truth,
meet public observation at all. To the world she was every thing
charming. But it is at home we must seek this woman in order to judge
her aright in this new phase of her strange life.</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Nelson's caprice to breakfast alone in a little room which
opened to the sunniest nook of the flower garden. In less than three
weeks after her marriage she began to separate her life from that of her
husband in every possible manner, and absolutely sold the fragments of
time which she doled out to him, bartering them off unblushingly for
some new extravagance, until even his absorbing passion revolted at her
egotism.</p>

<p>The room that we speak of was really an exquisite affair in its way;
very cheerful and sumptuous in all its appointments. Lace curtains were
looped back from the deep windows, so heavy with embroidery that they
fell over the pure plate-glass like snow wreaths floating over ice.
Through this transparent cloud came the cool rustle of tree boughs, the
gleam of flowers, and glimpses of warm sunshine, turning the grass to a
golden green. A broad mirror, surmounted by a wreath of gilded foliage,
reflected back this out-door picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span> from its limpid surface. The
carpet appeared but a continuation of the blossoming turf without; you
seemed to trample upon a living flower at every step, and the foot sank
luxuriously into its rich pile, as if pressing wood moss in a forest.
The hangings upon the walls were of pale green clustering with golden
roses. Small tables of oriental alabaster and delicate mosaic supported
vases of flowers, which shed a delicate perfume through the apartment.
Two easy chairs of the most elaborate construction, and a couch that
yielded to pressure like down, completed the rich assemblage.</p>

<p>Most regally did this apartment frame in the queenly woman who formed a
tableau of wonderful effect in its centre. The rare tone of her beauty
demanded delicate tints, and these were in direct contrast with the
colors that predominated in the room. Morning dresses, as they are now
worn, were not then in vogue, but a Canton crape dress, of a glowing
red, fell across her bosom in surplice folds, revealing glimpses of
costly lace underneath; the sleeves fitted her symmetrical arms to the
elbow, where they terminated in a fall of frost-like lace. A gossamer
cap seemed to have settled like a butterfly on the lustrous tresses
coiled around her proud head, which she crushed ruthlessly against the
back of her chair, rather than change her idle position. She held a
newspaper in her hand, while her foot rested on the ebony claw of a
small table, on which the frosted silver and delicate china of a
breakfast service were arranged.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nelson was no reader, but she loved to drone over the morning
papers after breakfast, picking up such fragments of gossip and news as
floated through their columns with satisfaction, so long as no effort of
thought was necessary. Thus her eyes roved restlessly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span> over the paper in
her hand until they fell upon the heading of a paragraph that sent the
bloom for a moment from her cheeks. It was an account of Katharine
Allen's trial. She read it breathlessly from beginning to end. A cloud
gathered on her fair forehead as she proceeded, which grew dark and
stormy when she approached the termination.</p>

<p>Jealousy is more likely to spring from self-love than from pure
affection. The pang which Mrs. Nelson felt was not the less keen because
she had no real regard for the man whom she had married. Her arrogant
vanity had been pampered till its craving could not be satisfied, and
the idea that another would dare lift admiring eyes to the man it had
been her pleasure to select, wounded her almost as if she had possessed
a heart. She remembered Katharine Allen as she had appeared that night
at her own humble home in the pine woods, and a clear conviction fell
upon her that Nelson Thrasher was in some way implicated in the trouble
that had fallen upon the girl. Had he&mdash;her slave, her spaniel, whom it
was her right to caress or spurn, dared to swerve from his allegiance to
her, even when she was the wife of another?</p>

<p>The question filled her heart with bitter scorn. She gloried over the
fact that this girl would be degraded and crushed out of respectable
life for having presumed to cross her path. She remembered the delicate
beauty which had been so remarkable that evening, and bit her lips
fiercely as the idea presented itself, that less adroit management on
her part might have placed Katharine in the honorable possession of all
she enjoyed so keenly. What if he should relent, even then? What if the
knowledge of this poor girl's terrible position should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span> touch the heart
she had herself trampled down so insolently, while it was loading her
with benefits!</p>

<p>She grasped the paper in her hand&mdash;no, no, he must never hear the news
it contained. She would change her course, and strive to endure his
society. He had grown sullen of late. What if his love for her should
change. The crowning passion of her character revolted at this, but
still a lurking fear crept in, and she reflected that the slavery of a
strong heart would not last forever.</p>

<p>She touched a curious little bell that stood on the table, and a servant
opened the door.</p>

<p>"Send me all the papers that have been brought this morning!"</p>

<p>The man went away and returned with several of the morning journals; she
glanced them over hurriedly, pressing her lips hard, while each column
was scanned. That paragraph was only to be found in the paper that lay
crushed in her lap. She arose hurriedly, and passing through the
entrance hall, swept toward the kitchen.</p>

<p>The cook stopped in the middle of the floor, struck with astonishment by
the presence of her haughty mistress in that place. Mrs. Nelson walked
toward the range, and taking up a heavy poker, thrust the newspaper into
the fire, holding it down till the fragments floated in black flakes
over her hand. She laid the poker down, observing that the woman was
regarding her curiously.</p>

<p>"Send in coffee, and some of those delicate French rolls which Mr.
Nelson is so fond of," she said, indifferently; "with any other nice
thing you can pick up."</p>

<span class="sub">LOVE'S GOLDEN HARVEST.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> cook was full of regrets that madame had been compelled to give her
own orders, and, amid a world of protestations, Mrs. Nelson went back to
her room. Soon after she rang the bell with emphasis, and directly that
exquisite breakfast service was re-arranged for two, and one of the
silken easy chairs rolled opposite her own.</p>

<p>"Go tell Mr. Nelson that I am waiting for him to breakfast with me," she
said, drawing close to the table, and forcing the clouds from her face.</p>

<p>She waited impatiently till the man came back, tapping the carpet with
her restless foot. What if she had gone too far? If he ever could have
thought of another might it not be so again? and she so completely in
his power, so helpless without his wealth.</p>

<p>The servant came back.</p>

<p>"Mr. Nelson's compliments, but he had taken breakfast hours ago."</p>

<p>The woman absolutely turned pale. It was the first time he had ever
refused an advance of any kind from her. She arose, stood in thought an
instant, and then left the room.</p>

<p>"Master is in his office, madame," said the servant.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know&mdash;he was not well this morning."</p>

<p>She swept through the hall again, and crossing two or three rooms,
entered one in the extreme southern wing of the house. In this place,
Nelson had, of late, taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span> his meals alone. It was simply an office
upon the ground floor, containing a few chairs, an oaken bookcase, heavy
with carving, and a library table, which stood in the centre of a small
Persian carpet. There was nothing very remarkable in this apartment,
except one thing. The floor was paved like the entrance hall, with a
rich mosaic pattern of variously tinted marble. Mrs. Nelson felt a chill
from the stones through her thin slippers, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Dear me, Nelson, what a dreary place you have! All wood work and stone.
I never observed how very comfortless it was before."</p>

<p>Nelson was locking something in a drawer of his writing-table, and his
face was bent, but she saw the blood rush to his forehead.</p>

<p>"I do not find it disagreeable," he said, gravely.</p>

<p>"Ah, but my room is so much pleasanter," she said, approaching the
table, and laying a hand caressingly on his arm.</p>

<p>He rose up suddenly, shaking her hand away.</p>

<p>The color mounted to her temples, but she controlled the temper that
burned within her.</p>

<p>"You are out of sorts, dear husband; and I am lonesome. Come away from
this cold room."</p>

<p>"It is not colder than usual," he answered, curtly; but a thrill ran
through his frame and the blood tingled in his veins. She had never
called him by that endearing name but once before, not even in the first
days of their marriage.</p>

<p>Her hand had fallen lightly on his wrist&mdash;she felt the leap of the
pulse, and smiled with inward triumph.</p>

<p>"Come, come. I am getting angry. How could you neglect me so? Busy,
busy, all the time; about what?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span> and I left alone! Come&mdash;this morning I
will take no refusal! You <i>shall</i> breakfast with me!"</p>

<p>Nelson took her hand, grasping it hard, and looked steadily in her face.</p>

<p>"Ellen, what is the meaning of this?"</p>

<p>"It means that I want to see my husband now and then, or he will forget
how much I love him."</p>

<p>Nelson shook his head. This sweet flattery was too sudden. It lacked the
ring of truth, and he felt it.</p>

<p>He looked at her sternly.</p>

<p>"Ellen!"</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?"</p>

<p>"What do you desire in exchange for these minutes of deception?"</p>

<p>"Nelson!"</p>

<p>"It is a simple question. If you have any wish ungratified, speak. This
cajolery is not necessary."</p>

<p>"You are cruel, Nelson."</p>

<p>He saw the tears mount slowly to her eyes; the hand which touched his,
trembled.</p>

<p>"You have ceased to love me, Nelson?"</p>

<p>She asked this question breathlessly; all the splendor of her position
seemed fading away. Her lips grew white, and she leaned heavily on the
table. Ambition spoke loudly as her heart should have done.</p>

<p>Her evident grief made his pulses leap. The white lips&mdash;the trembling of
those limbs. The emotion thus betrayed must be genuine. He stood
irresolute, looking at her. The thick lashes drooped over her eyes, her
bosom began to heave.</p>

<p>"Ellen, is this real?"</p>

<p>She lifted those velvety eyes to his, and the man was her slave again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
Three weeks from this day, two important things were concluded. A deed
of gift, conveying the mansion house, was made out in favor of Ellen
Nelson, and a large amount of foreign gold was deposited in one of the
leading city banks, subject to her order. Those few sweet words had
brought her a golden harvest; but what was that compared to the vast
wealth which still remained in her husband's power? wealth that could
not be brought out in the face of the world, though she had never been
permitted to know its hiding-place. While her husband held this great
secret back from her knowledge she could not feel altogether secure, for
what was moderate wealth to a woman who had dreamed so long of millions?</p>

<p>In the depth of his heart, Nelson may have felt that his secret was the
strongest tie that bound him to his wife. If so, it was one of those
cruel thoughts that men put away from their souls only to feel them
creeping back again like serpents. One thing is certain, he clung to the
secret of his gold with stern tenacity, and watched all her stealthy
movements toward it with the vigilance of a hound. The golden chains
with which his wife was bound became more important to him every day.
While he lived, that should fetter her to his side if love could not.
When he died&mdash;a shudder ran through his soul as he thought of that. Was
he certain that retribution would wait for him till then?</p>

<a name="lvii" id="lvii"></a>CHAPTER LVII.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">ONE HOUR OF SHAME.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A vessel</span> was being hauled in at the Long Wharf, at New Haven&mdash;a
weather-beaten vessel&mdash;that gave evidence of a long voyage over the
seas. Two men leaped from the deck, as she was slowly warped to her
moorings, and stood together a few moments at the head of the wharf.
They were both fine looking men, but in a different way. The one had a
frank, honest countenance, that expressed great natural vigor of mind,
joined with a physical organization of uncommon strength. The other was
lighter, taller, and more decidedly intellectual every way. Indeed, a
face like that was not met with on the same thoroughfare once in a
twelvemonth.</p>

<p>This man seemed eager to be moving; he held a small portmanteau in his
hands, while a few hurried words passed between him and his companion.</p>

<p>"Then you wont go into the town with me and give us both a fair start?"
said the stouter of the two. "The stage starts from Buck's Tavern at
daylight."</p>

<p>"No, no; I could not sleep, I could not rest within ten miles of home.
Think how long I have been away&mdash;of all that has happened."</p>

<p>"But we are four hours too late for the morning stage, captain."</p>

<p>"I know; but what then? It is but an easy walk after all. I can be there
before noon."</p>

<p>Rice laughed, and slily winked one eyelid.</p>

<p>"All right," he said; "this comes of being a married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span> man; a ten miles'
tramp, with a heart fluttering like a partridge all the way. Well, we
old bachelors have nothing to hurry for, and can afford to take it
comfortably. I'll go down to Bucks, and be at the old woman's to supper.
But keep dark; I want to come down upon her and Kate all of a sudden, to
say nothing of that little shaver and cuff&mdash;so keep a close lip,
captain."</p>

<p>The captain gave a happy laugh, thinking that he would be too pleasantly
employed for any chance at gossip, so he promised silence very
cordially, and the two shook hands.</p>

<p>"Good luck to you," exclaimed Rice, with hearty good will, "I'll be
after you in short order."</p>

<p>They parted here. The man with the portmanteau walking with rapid
strides toward the highway which led to the country, and our sailor
friend taking a more leisurely course into the town.</p>

<p>He was so busy with thoughts of home at first that a certain bustle and
excitement among the people upon the sidewalks failed to arrest his
attention. But as he approached the heart of the city this unusual
bustle aroused him. The people all seemed to be going one way, men
hurried along in eager haste, women jostled against each other in their
reckless movements, some dragging little children after them, and
scolding their slow progress.</p>

<p>Rice followed the current. He, too, became anxious to see what was
taking a whole population so completely in one direction, and having
plenty of time, sauntered on, with the easy roll learned in his home on
the rolling deep. He asked no questions, indeed he felt very little
interest in the matter. Something was going on&mdash;it might be a political
meeting, or "a general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span> training," it made very little difference to him
which it should prove. There seemed to be a crowd assembling somewhere,
and that was all he cared about the matter.</p>

<p>At last the throng of people grew so thick around one of these green
enclosures, common to the City of Elms, that Rice made his way onward
with some difficulty. He paused to take an observation, saw the great
square crowded full of people that murmured and swayed to and fro, when
new crowds poured in from the streets, as he had seen the ocean in many
a dangerous storm.</p>

<p>The general excitement fully aroused him now, and he looked keenly
around while elbowing his way through the human masses, asking the crowd
in general, and no one in particular, what the noise was about.</p>

<p>No one answered him. All were eagerly searching for commodious standing
room, and his questions remained unheeded. At last he saw, looming up in
the centre of the public green, a mass of timber, great, heavy oaken
posts, and a cross-beam rising above a scaffold, upon which a mass of
white, that possibly shrouded a human figure, was lifted above the
crowd.</p>

<p>Rice paused, with a sudden exclamation.</p>

<p>"What is that?" he said, turning to a female, who elbowed him fiercely
with one arm, lifting up her child with the other.</p>

<p>"What is it? Can't you see? Look for yourself. What should it be but a
gallows, and a woman on it?" cried the mother, lifting the little,
golden-haired girl on her shoulder, that she might command a view of the
show.</p>

<p>"A gallows, and a woman on it!" exclaimed Rice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span> losing half of his
ruddy color. "Oh, my good woman, what has the poor thing done?"</p>

<p>"Done! why, where did you come from? Done enough to hang her as high as
Haman, where she ought to be swinging this minute. Done, indeed!"</p>

<p>With these words the woman thrust herself forward, marking her rude
progress by the frightened face of the child, which rose and fell in
that ocean of human heads like some flower tossed upward by a storm.</p>

<p>A strange feeling seized upon Rice&mdash;a desperate wish to struggle through
the crowd, and flee from the spot. He turned and pressed blindly against
the human masses that heaved around him. But, in spite of his great
strength, they bore him onward like the waters of a vortex, till he was
flung, against his own will, almost at the foot of the gallows.</p>

<p>Yes; a woman was shrouded in that white drapery&mdash;a fair young girl, so
fair and so young that the sailor's heart melted with pity at the first
glance. How still and white she was. How like some of the Madonnas he
had seen in the churches and cathedrals of foreign parts; those hands
were folded under the cloud-like sleeves. She was very slender and
frail. Rice could trace the blue veins on her temples, and see the
quiver of her hands under the white drapery. A hideous thing was coiled,
like a great ash-colored serpent, around that delicate neck, and fell
writhing along the scaffold.</p>

<p>Rice uttered a cry of horror; something in that face smote all the
strength from his heart. The sight of that rope made him tremble like a
little child. The meek eyelids drooping over the shrinking agony of
those eyes, the mouth parting now and then from its tremulous pressure,
the small feet resting so helplessly on the scaffold. It was a pitiful
sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
I cannot explain why that craving desire to know who the criminal was,
seized upon the strong man, whose face the unhappy creature would not
have known had she lifted those heavy eyes? "Who is it? why is she here?
will no one tell me?"</p>

<p>An old woman, or the shadow of an old woman, who leaned against the
timbers of the gallows, looked up at this outcry, and her eyes settled
on his face. Then her poor withered hands were slowly lifted, and fell
helplessly into his.</p>

<p>"My son!"</p>

<p>"Mother&mdash;my mother, and looking so!"</p>

<p>"Hush!" she said, lifting her trembling finger, and pointing to the girl
on the scaffold. "It is our Katharine."</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="lviii" id="lviii"></a>CHAPTER LVIII.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">THE MOTHER AND SON.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Rice</span> did not speak&mdash;he did not move&mdash;a weight of blood fell back on his
heart, turning it to stone. He felt like a drowning man, with the
billows of a turbulent ocean heaving around him.</p>

<p>The old woman left her support against the timbers of the gallows, and
rested against him. Unconsciously he circled her with one arm. She
looked up in his face, and the slow relief of tears gathered in her
eyes.</p>

<p>All this had passed very quietly. No one saw it, for but few had heeded
the old woman who crept silently after the cortege when it left the
jail. As the sheriff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span> led his charge up to the scaffold, a stifled moan
had made him pause, and he saw a thin hand steal forth from the crowd
and touch that of the prisoner, without seeming to heed the act; for he
was a kind man, and guessed who the woman was. Then the strong, brave
son came up, and the old woman recognized him with sorrowful gladness;
but the crowd was eager for the spectacle of human shame, and cared
nothing for that.</p>

<p>Oh, how differently the half brother looked on that scaffold now! He saw
the delicate form drooping in the presence of a great multitude. The
sunlight fell around her with a soft, mocking radiance. Not even a cloud
crept mercifully into the heavens to vail her with shadows. Her eyes
were bent on the rough, unjoined boards beneath her feet. The tumult of
popular curiosity rose and swelled around her, but she never moved or
looked up. Coarse words and harsh revilings passed by her, but save a
quiver of the eyelids, you would not have known that she heard them.</p>

<p>As she sat thus meek and still while the minutes of her punishment
dropped into eternity, carrying her shame with them, the great multitude
around her grew turbulent. After all, what was it to walk so far and
stay so long only to see a young girl sitting upon a platform of boards,
without giving a sign or lifting her eyes? They had come to see a
murderess&mdash;something wild and exciting&mdash;a scene to frighten their
children with in after times, and talk over with the neighbors when
subjects of gossip ran low. Why did not the sheriff make her stand up
and confess her crime before them all? That would be something to
satisfy the law!</p>

<p>As the hour wore on these expressions of discontent grew strong. Men
shouted for her to stand up, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span> the mocking voices of disappointed
females scoffed at her with unwomanly fierceness.</p>

<p>All feelings are contagious when humanity crowds itself into masses.
Lashed by these jibes the people grew coarse and cruel&mdash;the meek silence
of the prisoner seemed like obstinacy to them. Her drooping face, half
hidden from their eager glances, had no right to evade them thus.</p>

<p>These murmurs of discontent grew turbulent and surged through the crowd
like the dashing of spent waves upon a rocky bank&mdash;a sea of human faces
waved to and fro, white and terrified with conflicting emotions. In all
that throng there was, perhaps, not one countenance which expressed
indifference; a great painter might have made his name immortal could he
have pictured that dense multitude as it really appeared. Men and women
looked cruel and hard, as if they longed to drag the miserable young
creature down from her place of shame with their own hands and put her
to death. Here and there a visage appeared which seemed to express
something akin to pity; but the most tender-hearted would hardly have
ventured, amid that excited populace, to have expressed a word of
sympathy.</p>

<p>In the midst of this tumult Rice heard a voice close to his elbow, which
hissed in his ear like a serpent. A rough looking man stood by him with
a face full of cruel mockery uplifted to the gallows. He stooped down
and spoke to a lad who stood near:</p>

<p>"Go and give the halter a jerk, my little fellow, and I'll pay ye a
ninepence the minute it's done. If you pull her off so much the better;
I'll make the ninepence a shilling!"</p>

<p>These were the words which made Rice start, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span> look fiercely around.
He saw the boy, an evil-visaged imp, skulking away toward the gallows.
Looking back over his shoulder, with a sly, cunning smile.</p>

<p>"Mother, stand alone one minute," he said, in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>The old woman could not stand without support, but she fell back against
the gallows timbers, looking wildly in his face. He waited for nothing,
but sprang into the crowd with the bound of a panther, grappled the lad
by the throat, just as his hand touched an end of the rope which had
fallen over the scaffold. With the strength of a giant he lifted the boy
high in the air with both hands, and pitched him far over the heads of
the multitude. Here the urchin fluttered and turned, like some uncouth
bird, till he was engulfed by the crowd, amid shouts of laughter and
wild exclamations of astonishment.</p>

<p>Pale and trembling with rage, Rice turned upon the man who had
instigated this dastardly act, but the craven took prompt warning, and
plunged into the crowd, which, closing upon him, left Rice with his hand
clenched and specks of foam trembling on his lips. A hand was laid
heavily on his shoulder. Thinking it was some constable ready to arrest
him, Rice turned, but only to meet a mild and elderly face, whose placid
eyes looked gently into his. It was old Mr. Thrasher.</p>

<p>"Stop, stop, my friend. Let the laws be fulfilled without tumult. God
may be doing a great work here."</p>

<p>"But what is man now doing, I should like to know?" cried the angry
sailor. "Can your God look down on such work as this and not hate the
people He has made? Look at this girl! look at the old woman yonder! My
mother and my sister!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
"Your mother&mdash;sister! Then you are David Rice?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am Dave Rice, that old woman's son. I hadn't seen her for nigh
upon eight years, and this is how I find her!" cried Dave, shaking all
over with a burst of grief; "and that's how I find my half sister, the
sweetest little child that man ever sat eyes on."</p>

<p>Great tears trembled in his eyes and dropped down his cheeks, he wiped
them away with the cuff of his sailor's jacket, dashing his hand down in
a passion of self-contempt.</p>

<p>"What has the girl done? What does this all mean? If you know, tell
me&mdash;do tell me!"</p>

<p>"Be calm&mdash;be still!"
<a name="answered" id="answered"></a><ins title="Original has aswered">answered</ins> Thrasher, in a voice that
carried soothing in its very tones. "She is innocent as a lamb."</p>

<p>"Innocent, and there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I say it again, in spite of her trial&mdash;in spite of her sentence,
just now commenced. Your sister is innocent of the murder."</p>

<p>"The murder! God help us!"</p>

<p>"The murder of her child!"</p>

<p>"Her child! My little sister's child!"</p>

<p>"Wait&mdash;wait till you see her. She has bound me by a promise, but you are
her brother, and have rights. I am glad you have come. With your
knowledge of sea-life he may be found. My son, Nelson Thrasher, I mean."</p>

<p>"Nelson Thrasher! And what has he to do with her and this?"</p>

<p>"Nothing with this. It would distress him as it does us, but he is
away&mdash;knows nothing about it, and she&mdash;&mdash;But, hush! the time is up. The
sheriff tells her to come down."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
The two men moved closer to the scaffold. At the voice of the sheriff
Katharine lifted her head slowly, and cast a frightened look at the
crowd, which became more and more riotous as the hour closed. For the
first time that day a faint flush stole to her forehead, and her eyes
quailed with affright from all the eager faces uplifted toward her. The
sheriff spoke again before she attempted to arise. Then a voice followed
his, saying:</p>

<p>"Take courage, Katharine, we are here!"</p>

<p>She knew the voice well, arose, unsteadily, to her feet, and staggered,
in a blind way, across the scaffold, with her arms held out. The
changeable mob began to pity her then, for the sight of her face might
have moved the very stones to compassion. More kindly murmurs reached
her; you could see it by the quiver of her features and the pathetic
helplessness with which she looked toward the spot whence the voices
came.</p>

<p>David Rice could bear the scene no longer; he rushed by the sheriff,
sprang upon the scaffold, and took the unhappy girl in his arms, crying
out:</p>

<p>"Katy, Katy! God forgive them, for they are killing you! My sister, my
little sister!"</p>

<p>She may have heard his voice, and the name by which he called her; if
so, it smote the remaining strength from her frame, for she fell away in
his arms, limp and dead, like a lily broken at the stalk.</p>

<p>The sheriff would have taken her from those strong arms, but Rice waved
him back.</p>

<p>"Don't be afeared, don't be afeared," he said, hoarse with grief; "I
shan't run away with the poor lamb; but she's dead, and no one but her
brother shall touch her. Keep as close as you like. Show me the way to
her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span> prison. I aint a going to break any law; but she's my sister, and
that poor old soul there is my mother. Help her along, if you've got a
heart, and leave this poor lamb to me."</p>

<p>The sheriff had no heart to separate the prisoner from her newly-found
brother; he would even have aided old Mrs. Allen, as Rice had desired,
but Mr. Thrasher and his good wife were by her side, supporting her with
such kindly help that any offers of assistance would have been
intrusive. Thus surrounded by constables, the little group gathered in a
close knot, carrying Katharine Allen from her place of shame.</p>

<p>The crowd fell back reverently before Rice, who followed the sheriff
with the tread of a lion, while that white face rested on his shoulder.
This last anguish had left her like a corpse before the crowd had
changed all its impatient revilings into compassion. The children looked
frightened or began to cry when they saw terror or tears upon their
mother's cheeks. The men grew pale, and looked at each other
upbraidingly, as the Jews must have done when the great sacrifice was
urged forward by their hands.</p>

<p>Thus the little group passed away from the crowd and into the dark
shadows of a prison, which seemed like heaven to this poor girl when she
came to life, with the remembrance of all those glaring eyes and
scowling faces turning their hate upon her.</p>

<br />
<span class="sub">THE EMPTY HOUSE.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> David Rice left the jail that night, he had the certificate of his
sister's marriage in his bosom, and under it was a stern resolve to find
out the man who had left her to the chance of all this suffering, and
bring him to a stern account.</p>

<p>There was no need of his going further now; all the bright hopes of the
morning were swept away. The broken household around that prison was all
he could find of his old home. But the gloom of this place was too
oppressive; fresh from the broad sweep of the ocean, he could not
breathe in all this close misery.</p>

<p>The next day, Rice escaped from the contemplation of all this ruin, and
took a long walk into the country, bending his way toward Hotchkistown.
The rapid exercise cooled the fever of his blood, while it deepened the
profound compassion excited by his sister's wrongs. As he was passing
under the shadows of the East Rock, a traveller, coming from an opposite
direction, appeared in the distance. Rice instantly knew the little
valise and the upright figure of the man. It was the companion from whom
he had parted only the day before. But why had he returned so soon? What
was the meaning of that quick, almost fierce, walk?</p>

<p>The two men drew close to each other, and, pre-occupied as they were,
stopped abruptly in mutual surprise, each astonished by the change that
had come upon the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
"Rice, my poor friend!"</p>

<p>"Captain, what is the matter? I know that you have heard; but my
troubles can't have done this."</p>

<p>The stranger wrung the hand which Rice held out, but he did not
speak&mdash;the encounter had come upon him suddenly.</p>

<p>"You found all well at home, I hope," said Rice. "Don't tell me that any
thing has gone wrong there, I couldn't stand it."</p>

<p>The stranger wrung his friend's hand again. "Rice, I found the house
empty."</p>

<p>"Empty! What, moved?"</p>

<p>"Gone, both of them; God only knows where."</p>

<p>"Gone!"</p>

<p>"No one can tell me where. The house was shut up. The grass had grown
high around the gate. The bucket from long disuse had dropped to pieces
on the well-pole. This is all that I can gather of a certainty."</p>

<p>"And did the neighbors know nothing?"</p>

<p>"They told me a great deal, but it led to nothing; my wife really gave
no one an idea of what she intended to do. I see how it is; she was very
proud, and thinking herself compelled to work for a living went off into
some strange place. It was like her, but where can I go, how search her
out? She left no trace. Surely she might have waited a few months
longer!"</p>

<p>The proud anguish in his friend's voice drew Rice from his own troubles.</p>

<p>"Come," he said, "I will turn back, and we will talk this over. Some way
will be found. 'Never give up the ship.' That has been our motto for
many a day, captain. The storm has burst on me, and it may reach you,
but we'll sail in the same boat anyhow."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
"But this suspense is terrible, Rice. Does it seem possible that a man
should be made so wretched in a single day? But for this hard walk I
should have gone crazy."</p>

<p>"I know what it is, captain; all my timbers are shaking now with what
happened yesterday, but I've seen many a wreck come up shipshape again.
Let's keep afore the breeze, if it does blow a gale. I feel sartin that
our course lies the same way, somehow. Here, give us hold of your
valise. You look clean tuckered out."</p>

<p>The man surrendered his valise with a faint smile, saying:</p>

<p>"I only intended to go on a little till the stage overtook me, but
forgot all about it, or that I was walking fast, till ten minutes' rest
convinced me how tired I was." That moment the heavy stage-coach came
swinging round a corner of the turnpike, its four horses galloping
forward in a cloud of dust, through which a bright, boyish face was seen
leaning out of the window.</p>

<p>"Hallo, there, I say, you driver, let me out&mdash;hurry&mdash;can't you hear a
fellow? What are you thinking on?"</p>

<p>The driver heard this energetic shout above the tramp of his horses, and
drew up, covering the travellers by the way-side with a storm of dust.</p>

<p>The lad opened the heavy stage door for himself and sprang out, telling
the driver, with a magnificent flourish of the hand, that he could treat
himself with the extra fare, paid in advance, from Hotchkistown to New
Haven. Then he began advising two old ladies in the back seat to take a
little more room and make themselves comfortable, a piece of
consideration that was cut short by a sharp crash of the door, and a
lurch of the stage, which set the establishment in motion again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
Left alone in the street our friend Tom took a rapid survey of the two
men, and advanced toward them, lifting his new straw hat, which sported
a red ribbon around the crown, after a fashion which he had admired
greatly in little Paul, and regarding this a proper occasion, practiced
with considerable effect. He glanced at Rice with a rather dissatisfied
air, and partly turned his back on him while addressing the other
person.</p>

<p>"I reckoned I should find you somewhere on the road, captain, and so cut
after," he said, turning his back decidedly on Rice. "Expected to find
you all alone, though."</p>

<p>"This person is my friend."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, but he isn't mine, so if you'd just as lief step round back
of that juniper bush, mebby I'll tell you something."</p>

<p>The person addressed as captain accepted this invitation, and walked to
the other side of a juniper tree, which stood close by, heavy with
clusters of blue berries. Tom followed the stranger with one hand thrust
into his trowser's pocket, from which came a faint rustle of paper.</p>

<span class="sub">TOM HUTCHINS' LETTER.</span></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">When</span> you was at our house, talking to par, I heard purty much all that
was said, and should a heard it all if it hadn't been for the squalling
of the young uns. Now he didn't know a circumstance to what I did. Just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
driving a person down to a sloop don't amount to nothing, if you can't
tell where she was a going."</p>

<p>"True enough, my young friend; but what more can you tell me?"</p>

<p>"Well now, if you'll promise not to laugh or poke fun at me, I'll up and
tell."</p>

<p>"Well, I promise that."</p>

<p>"And you wont be mad, nor nothing?"</p>

<p>"I think not."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;and&mdash;" Here Tom grew red as a winter apple, and stammered most
unmerciful.</p>

<p>"Well, and what? I dare say you can ask nothing which I will not
promise."</p>

<p>"Well, you wont set yourself agin me and Rose when we've grown up,
and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>The stranger started, and his countenance changed.</p>

<p>"What can you know of my&mdash;of Rose?" he said, sharply.</p>

<p>"Oh, now you're getting mad!"</p>

<p>"No, no; but you tell me nothing."</p>

<p>Tom withdrew his hand and buttoned up the pocket with emphasis.</p>

<p>"Besides that, I aint a going to. How far is it back to Bungy? I can
foot it there afore dark, and no harm done."</p>

<p>"But you had something to tell me."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Come all this way a purpose to tell it. Now I'm going back
agin&mdash;no damage to nobody."</p>

<p>The captain grew pale with anxiety.</p>

<p>"Tell me what you desire, and speak out," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't desire nothing of nobody. Ask our doctor if I'm that sort
of chap; but you come to our house and asked questions about a lady that
I know, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span> a sort of mealy-mouthed way, as if you didn't like to speak
out and say to old neighbors, 'She's gone off and I don't know where.'
Par didn't know, and consequently couldn't tell. I kinder did; but with
the old folks by, and the baby squalling, what could a feller do?"</p>

<p>"Where&mdash;where are they?"</p>

<p>"Now there's the question. I want to make a bargain with you."</p>

<p>"Boy, boy, this is too much."</p>

<p>Tom Hutchins looked at him earnestly.</p>

<p>"I'll trust you!" he exclaimed, unbuttoning his pocket in breathless
haste, and drawing forth a tiny letter, folded after the peculiar
fashion that school-girls affect. "Perhaps you know that ere
writing&mdash;scrumptious fine hand, aint it? Jest look on the outside&mdash;<i>Mr.</i>
Thomas Hutchins&mdash;don't it look splendid?"</p>

<p>As Tom uttered these words, he unfolded the dainty little epistle, and
held it forth.</p>

<p>The captain's hand shook as he received the paper, and a mist came over
his eyes before it was read through.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Mr. Thomas Hutchins:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>:&mdash;I take up my pen to inform you that I am in good
health, and hope you are enjoying the same blessing. I have got
a nice gentleman and lady to live with, and am learning French
like any thing. There is a colored man called Jube, and a young
gentleman named Paul. They know French, and help me to speak it.
I have got your robins' eggs yet, and mean to keep them all my
life. Please do not let any one see this letter. I promised you
to write the minute we got anywhere; but it was a long time
before I knew how people sent letters; besides, I didn't know
how to write<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span> fine hand then. Direct your letter to Miss Rose
Mason, Bays Hollow. It will reach me; for since mother went
away, there isn't any Miss Mason but me."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There seemed to be some trouble about ending the letter, for two
attempts at erasure with a penknife were visible; but it finally
concluded with the girlish signature of</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right2">"Your loving friend,</p>
<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Rose Mason</span>."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The captain read this letter over and over again, till the tears rose to
his eyes and his chest began to heave.</p>

<p>"Will you give me this letter, boy?" he said, in a broken voice.</p>

<p>"Couldn't," said Tom. "Money hasn't got power to buy it. You'd think so
if you only knew how much time it took for me to write the answer."</p>

<p>"And you think Rose is in this place now?"</p>

<p>"Think! Don't I know it. Haven't I reckoned up how much it would cost to
get there fifty times! Only to think of hearing her talk French! My!"</p>

<p>The captain reached forth his hand, and shook that of Tom, with deep
emotion.</p>

<p>"What can I do for you, my boy?" he said.</p>

<p>"Nothing; only if you go to the Hollow, don't forget to give my best
respects to Miss Rose Mason, and tell her&mdash;no, you needn't say nothing
about it&mdash;what's the use?"</p>

<p>"I will tell her that you are a brave, generous boy, and that I am
eternally indebted to you," said the captain.</p>

<p>"That's very kind of you captin; but if you could only say man&mdash;now a
generous man&mdash;I should be much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span> obliged. You haven't no idea how much
too short my winter trowsers are!"</p>

<p>"I will say any thing to prove how happy you have made me. The dear
child&mdash;and this is her writing?" answered the captain, reading the
letter a third time.</p>

<p>Tom watched him keenly, till the blood mounted into his fine face. Some
great struggle was going on in his heart, that at last burst forth in
words.</p>

<p>"Take it," he said; "keep the letter. I give it up; but when you see her
remember that it bust my heart to do it. Good-by, captain. Some time or
another I shall want something of you, but wait till I've stopped
growing. There's all the world afore us. Good-by."</p>

<p>The captain called after him. Tom refused to look back, but marched off
at a quick pace, waving his hand. The truth is, our youngster's face was
bathed in tears. It really had almost broken his heart to give up the
letter&mdash;the first and dearest epistle of his life.</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="lxi" id="lxi"></a>CHAPTER LXI.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">UNSATISFIED VANITY.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Nelson</span> had placed a Nemesis in his household, and she gave him full
measure of retribution. The few days of sunshine which he had purchased,
soon faded away; and he was left to wander to and fro in that splendid
house, more desolate than the pauper whom his wife sent haughtily from
his door.</p>

<p>Step by step, the woman for whom he had sacrificed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span> every thing, became
a very tyrant in his house. Indifferent at first, then arrogant, and at
last insufferably insolent, she scarcely gave him breathing room in his
own home. The very tread of his foot in the vestibule filled her with a
sort of resentment, as if he had no right, in any degree, to disturb the
luxury of her existence. Nothing but her insatiable vanity won for him
even a gleam of favor. That was the strong passion of her nature, and in
its complete gratification she sometimes condescended to endure his
presence with some show of cheerfulness.</p>

<p>True, Mrs. Nelson was now comparatively independent. A few short weeks
of coquetry&mdash;for that is really the name by which her attempts at
affection should be given&mdash;had won this much from her infatuated victim;
but it often happens that a woman who scatters her husband's money with
recklessness, proves parsimonious where her own is concerned. This was
the case with Mrs. Nelson; she had no fancy for diminishing her own
resources; on the contrary, she had, without consulting Nelson, placed
them in a way to command more than the usual interest, at the inevitable
result of more than ordinary risk.</p>

<p>Thus the demands of unlimited extravagance made it important that
something like marital cordiality should be maintained with her husband,
and from this necessity, gleams of coquettish affection would sometimes
break upon his loneliness, which she foolishly believed would always
prove sufficient to keep him at her feet.</p>

<p>It is generally the dregs of poor wine that become sour. That love can
turn to hate, no one who ever felt the true passion will believe. But
there are mixed feelings that combine with affection in evil natures,
like foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span> ingredients in the wine, and these yield to circumstances
as that does to the atmosphere, turning to indifference, contempt, or
hate, as the case may be.</p>

<p>This change was going on with Nelson. His wife did not see it, for, with
a good deal of cleverness, she had not the intellect to comprehend a
character like his. Her reign over him had been so complete&mdash;he had
received her slightest favors with such gratitude&mdash;that any idea of
revolt never entered her mind. A few blandishments had always obtained
power over him to any extent, and these she had always at command.</p>

<p>But she too was setting up a Nemesis in the household, not the less
powerful that it was slow to come.</p>

<p>This woman's life had become one wild commotion&mdash;nothing contented her.
The desire of one day was flung off by the caprice of the next. The
house was one thoroughfare of fashion. Her position once acknowledged in
that world which every one talks of, but which, in a republic like ours,
is never permanently defined&mdash;her hold upon it became complete; but it
was maintained at great cost; morning breakfasts, evening parties, and
those exquisite little suppers which are the gems of a sumptuous
establishment, came and went in endless succession. Her life was a
triumph of vanity&mdash;her ambition fulfilled. She had no character for
higher aspirations, and only aimed at something new, something that
would sweep all social competition aside.</p>

<p>This was altogether opposed to Nelson's ideas of domestic life. His
ambition was of a sterner nature. He wanted power abroad, and domestic
love at home. But the woman he had chosen overshadowed him with her
dashing frivolity&mdash;put him aside with her insolent pretension. His
strong nature revolted at last. Month<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span> after month he had walked through
her magnificent festivities like a stranger, scarcely recognized by her
guests, or approached by herself, unless the great need of money brought
her smiling to his presence, and all this time one fact was brooding in
his mind&mdash;for all his love the woman had given him nothing.</p>

<p>These thoughts hardened the rich man against the woman he had almost
adored. He grew sombre and stern as a rock. No one ever saw him smile,
or if he did, the gleam of a serpent stole into his eyes, revealing the
venom within. This state of things might have gone on for months,
perhaps years, but for a new source of excitement which the lady had
searched out for herself. Hitherto the expense and ostentation of her
life had been its chief objection. But display requires great genius in
its arrangement not to become monotonous, and of all things on earth the
routine of a merely fashionable life is the least interesting. Mrs.
Nelson began to feel this. Even the triumphs of her vanity grew sickly;
she wanted new fields for display. This feeling led her to the very
verge of a precipice. There was one corner in Nelson's heart in which a
sleeping serpent lay coiled, which even she must not dare to arouse. But
with her usual audacity she trampled even there.</p>

<p>In New York there is always a floating population of foreigners whose
business it is to be amused, and who have, with the aid of liberal
travel abroad, introduced many customs into our republican society which
a New Englander of any class is not quite prepared to accept.</p>

<p>Now Mrs. Nelson began to weary of her fashionable dissipation&mdash;the
attentions of those very men made one of the chief attractions of her
life. They were invited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span> to her house; she received with pleasure their
exaggerated flatteries, and gradually her whole mode of thought became
so changed that the woman was scarcely to be recognized.</p>

<p>What Nelson suffered at first is beyond the power of description;
although it wounded his pride terribly, he gave these troubles no
utterance, and had scarcely expressed a word of disapproval, but his
brow grew heavy with frowns and an iron pressure of the mouth became
habitual. He never sought his wife's presence now, and even passed her,
if they chanced to meet, with lowering avoidance.</p>

<p>With this new caprice Mrs. Nelson's extravagance had somewhat abated,
and having no special favors to ask, she treated her husband's frowns
with the utmost disdain, if for a moment they excited her attention. He
took no pains to enforce his displeasure upon her, but with stolid
firmness went on his way.</p>

<p>During her married life this woman had made many efforts to find out the
sources of her husband's wealth, but except that all her expenditures
were supplied in foreign gold, she could form no real idea of his
resources. But this fact convinced her that he must have made vast
investments abroad, and the strongest desire she had left was to
ascertain the exact position and amount of these investments, which, in
the end, must, she was certain, become her own, either by depletion or
bequest.</p>

<p>But for the fixed conviction of his wife's indifference, the art of this
woman would, in the end, have gained the information she craved; but
Nelson felt that in this secret lay his entire hold on her. In fact he
dared not trust her or divide the corroding anxieties of his existence
with any human being.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
At length, in the pauses of a foreign flirtation, for with her these
things never approached a point beyond that of gratified vanity, she
began to reflect on the persistent silence of her husband, and viewing
him as the source of all her luxuries, became vaguely uneasy, as she had
done once before, lest he should escape her control.</p>

<p>One evening, when it chanced that she had no visitors, this doubt came
across her, and under its influence she went in search of her husband.</p>

<h2><a name="lxii" id="lxii"></a>CHAPTER LXII.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">ARTFUL FASCINATIONS.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Thrasher</span> was sitting alone in the room we have spoken of, reading or
appearing to read, a large book that lay open on the library table. The
rustle of a purple brocaded dress as it swept over the tessellated
floor, disturbed him. He raised his head and looked steadily in his
wife's face as she approached, but without a sign either of gladness or
anger.</p>

<p>"Always alone," she said, playfully leaning over his shoulder&mdash;"always
studying and leaving his poor wife to her solitude."</p>

<p>He looked at her keenly, turning his head with a gesture of avoidance,
but still reading her with his eyes.</p>

<p>"What do you want now, madame?"</p>

<p>She absolutely turned pale to the lips. There was no anger in his tone,
but it cut through her flippancy like a sword.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
"What do I want, Nelson?" she faltered.</p>

<p>"Yes, how much?"</p>

<p>The tones were sharp with sarcasm; she winced under them, and slowly
removed her arm from his shoulder. The massive bracelets she wore
jingled faintly with the motion. Nelson glanced at them with a bitter
sneer.</p>

<p>"Those things were not among the jewels I gave you."</p>

<p>She flushed to the temples.</p>

<p>"No," she said, with some truth; "you always seemed anxious and
troubled, so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So you accepted these from some one else?"</p>

<p>"No, I bought them. Who would give me any thing that I cannot purchase
for myself? The jeweller imported them expressly to tempt me."</p>

<p>She resumed all her confidence now. This allusion to the jewels soothed
her into the idea that it was only a spasm of jealousy which had
influenced his words. She leaned her white arm on his shoulder again,
and touched his cheek with her own, glancing down on the book he had
been reading.</p>

<p>He closed the volume suddenly, and leaned his arm upon it.</p>

<p>"And you wont let me read?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Want me out of the way, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>The woman rose to her full height, and in her haughty anger would have
swept from the room, but on second thought she drew a chair, and sat
down opposite him, leaning her arm on the table.</p>

<p>"Nelson," she said, in her clear, rich voice, which, spite of herself,
shook with suppressed passion, "you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span> are angry because I have had so
little time to give you of late."</p>

<p>He looked her steadily in the face.</p>

<p>"No, Ellen, I am not angry at any thing."</p>

<p>"Then why are you so stern with me?"</p>

<p>"Because I am myself again."</p>

<p>The woman was really frightened; the impolicy of her late conduct forced
itself upon her; for a moment she sat biting her lips in silence.</p>

<p>"You had better go to your room," he said, quietly; "the marble floor is
cold."</p>

<p>"Not half as cold as your heart," she answered, with a burst of tears.
"Ah, Nelson, how can you treat me so cruelly? Me, who&mdash;who&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who love me so dearly," he said, with one of the most cutting sneers
that ever disfigured a man's countenance.</p>

<p>These were the very words she had been trying to utter, but they lodged
in her throat. He had anticipated the falsehood with a sneer. She arose
haughtily. Tears rolled down her flushed cheeks. She was really a
beautiful woman; but her loveliness had no effect on him then. In her
reckless vanity she had wounded him almost beyond repair, and his bosom
serpent crested itself fiercely.</p>

<p>"I did not expect this," she said, in pale anger. "You shall never have
a chance to insult me again."</p>

<p>"I did not seek it now. It is not my wish that you should ever come
here."</p>

<p>"Why, what great secret do you keep in this room?" she said, speaking at
random, in her anger. "One would think you had a hidden treasure here."</p>

<p>The sudden pallor that spread over his face struck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span> her dumb; what had
she said to arouse this white rage? The words escaped her memory as they
were uttered, but they had given him a blow on the heart. Nelson
recovered himself promptly.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, with less of bitterness in his voice, "you have chosen
to seek me without invitation and without motive, so far as I can
understand. If you have any business, let me know it?"</p>

<p>"Cannot a woman visit her husband without special business?" retorted
the wife.</p>

<p>"Her husband?" he repeated, in a low, sneering voice.</p>

<p>She burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Nelson, this is cruel."</p>

<p>"Cruel; I thought you did not understand the term!"</p>

<p>She could control her passion no longer, but stamped angrily on the
marble floor with her foot.</p>

<p>"Nelson Thrasher, this is too much, after persecuting me with your
attentions, begging me upon your knees to become your wife. I am
insulted in my own house, sneered at almost before my own servants,
neglected, trampled on&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be silent, madame! these complaints are false. It is I who have been
outraged and insulted; set at naught under my own roof; left to
solitude, when my heart ached for the company of my wife; and all
because I brought to you a devotion more perfect than man ever gave to
woman; because I loved you well enough to deserve the contempt which you
rain upon me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Nelson began to cry and wring her hands at this, and, after the
fashion of widows who marry a second time, sobbed out: "It was no more
than she deserved. Oh, if her first husband had only lived&mdash;never in
his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span> whole life had he spoken a harsh word to her. Alas, what a fool she
had been!"</p>

<p>Nelson heard her impatiently; the mention of Captain Mason did not
soften his heart, but closed it even against her tears and the beauty
that they brightened, as dews refresh a rose.</p>

<p>She paused in her grief, and looked at him from under her wet eyelashes.
The tears rendered her glance very tender and sorrowful. His countenance
softened. She saw it; and, going round the table, leaned over his chair,
fanning his cheek with her breath.</p>

<p>"Nelson, have you really ceased to love me?"</p>

<p>There was truth in the bottom of the man's heart, and he could not
answer "Yes;" so he was silent, and sat beneath her caresses with
downcast eyes. At last he looked up. There was forgiveness in his face,
but it was stern and pale.</p>

<p>"Ellen, I did love you&mdash;I bought you at a fearful price. How much I
gave, how much I risked, you will never know. How miserable I have been,
you can never guess. All I asked was a little love and some show of
respect. You gave me neither. I could not win them with entreaties or
buy them with gold. You never loved me. You never liked me, Ellen."</p>

<p>She moved closer to him. The dew upon her cheek cooled his anger. He
could not hate her quite yet. The time might come; but it was sweet to
put it off, even for a little while.</p>

<p>"But I love you now."</p>

<p>As this soft whisper fell upon his heart, the serpent that had lifted
his crest so angrily settled down, and went to sleep stupidly, as if it
never would uncoil again.</p>

<p>The woman bore her triumph with caution, and would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span> not seem elated. She
sank to his side on one knee, forcing him to support her head with his
hand, which yielded to the guidance of her soft touch, as the stern
heart had given way to her caressing speech.</p>

<p>"You have been very harsh with me," was her sweet reproach; "and all
because I cannot be happy when you will not trust me."</p>

<p>"Trust you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; you keep secrets from me. You are jealous because other men admire
me."</p>

<p>"No, Ellen; I am jealous because you have no value for my admiration,
not because others think you beautiful."</p>

<p>"But you keep secrets from me."</p>

<p>"What secrets?" he faltered.</p>

<p>"Oh, a great many."</p>

<p>She dared not come to the point at once for his face was growing dark
again.</p>

<p>She watched his face keenly&mdash;it lowered like a thunder cloud. That
pretence of jealousy was only a decoy subject&mdash;she cared nothing for his
early love, but was painfully intent on gaining his secret of the
treasures. Without that knowledge she must be forever at his
mercy&mdash;always going through scenes like the one which had just passed,
or sink back into comparative poverty by abandoning him altogether. The
partial independence which he had bestowed only made her more eager for
new concessions.</p>

<p>"Then you have other secrets. Where is all the great wealth you told me
of. I never saw it. I have no proof that it exists."</p>

<p>She spoke very naturally, but he understood her drift, and knew, in the
depths of his heart, that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span> this secret which chained her in that
loving position at his knee. Still, with his softened feelings, it was
pleasant to have her there at any cost, so he played with the question
as a good angler trifles with his fly on the surface of a lake.</p>

<p>"You have the best of all proof, Ellen&mdash;that of spending the money."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know; but what is that compared to the confidence of one's
husband?"</p>

<p>He smiled almost pleasantly, leaned forward, and opening the book which
had been closed from her inspection, pointed out a page with his finger.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;the Bible!" she exclaimed, astonished at the nature of his
studies.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, quietly. "I was reading the history of Sampson."</p>

<p>She looked at him a moment, and the blood mounted slowly to her
forehead. He saw the flush, and turned away his eyes.</p>

<p>Not another word was spoken. She arose from her half kneeling posture,
and he stood up.</p>

<p>"You will not trust me now," was her gentle leave-taking, "because you
think I do not love you, but time will show how mistaken you are."</p>

<p>She reached up her mouth to be kissed, but he touched her forehead with
his lips, and she went away as she came, rustling her silks luxuriously
along the mosaic floor.</p>

<p>He followed her with his eyes till she disappeared, then sat down,
supporting his forehead with one hand.</p>

<p>"Ah, what a creature she is," he murmured. "If one could only buy her in
selling himself to perdition, what man would shrink from the price? But
who can say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span> that he possesses her? My secret! No, Ellen Mason! that is
your chain!&mdash;the shackle that keeps you here! I will never break
it&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>A noise at the door caused him to look up. She had come back, and stood
smiling upon him.</p>

<p>"You defy me&mdash;you liken me to that woman in the Bible, and keep secrets
from me&mdash;this is a good reason for amusing myself elsewhere. I will not
do that any more. Keep your secret, and hoard your treasures. I will not
trouble you concerning them. Only let us be friends. There will be no
happiness for either of us without that."</p>

<p>The woman offered her kisses again, and this time he did not avoid her
lips&mdash;still she could not feel that her victory was complete.</p>

<p>After she had gone, Nelson cast his eyes on the floor, and started with
an exclamation of dismay. When his wife fell into her passion she had
stood directly over the centre ornament in the massive floor, a secret
spring had yielded to the stamp of her foot, the stone had whirled from
its place, leaving an opening of some inches, circling half around the
centre ornament like a crescent.</p>

<p>"Had the woman seen this?"</p>

<p>The thought made him wild; great drops started to his forehead, while he
fell upon his knees, and strove to replace the stone. It shot back to
its groove, completing the Mosaic pattern. When all was secure, he sat
down and fell into thought. A feeling of insecurity seized upon him;
would this woman wrest his secrets from him after all&mdash;not by her
fascinations, but through craft and watchfulness?</p>

<p>No; he would make sure against that. The ornament might give way again,
but it should tell no secrets.</p>

<span class="sub">GATHERING APPLES.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Little</span> Paul was standing under the apple tree, with Rose Mason close by.
The thick grass under their feet was littered with golden apples,
streaked with rosy red, which Jube had shaken from the boughs.</p>

<p>"Here, little missus," cried the negro, looking down through the thick
leaves, and balancing a noble apple in his hand. "Hold up your apron,
little missus, and down it will come so pretty into the white nest, so."</p>

<p>Rose lifted her little apron of ruffled dimity, and held it up, laughing
and shaking her golden curls in the sunbeams, the happiest little
creature alive.</p>

<p>"Be careful," cried Paul, looking fondly on the beautiful creature.
"Don't you drop it on her head, Jube; it would almost kill her."</p>

<p>Jube laughed, and dropped the apple, which fell plump into the apron,
but with a force that tore it from the grasp of those tiny hands; so,
after all, the apple rolled away into the grass.</p>

<p>Both Paul and Rose made a plunge. The boy seized upon the apple first,
and held it over his head, tempting Rose, with his bright eyes laughing
pleasantly. She leaped after it, and danced up and down like a fairy,
for her little feet scarcely trampled the grass.</p>

<p>Paul was taller, by a whole foot, than the little girl, so he held the
fruit out of reach, smiling with his lips, and laughing with his eyes,
at her graceful efforts. Jube got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span> astride a huge limb of the apple
tree, and looked down upon the fun, showing his teeth through the
leaves. The minister stood at his study window, benignly regarding them,
drawn from his manuscript sermon by their riotous shouts of laughter;
while his wife, who was sewing on the back porch, sat with her needle
half suspended, smiling brightly on the scene.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant sight, and the whole family enjoyed it with all the
zest of innocent hearts. The good housewife loved those two children
almost as if they had been her own, and as for Jube, the heart must have
been hard indeed which did not turn kindly to the good negro, who
brought his huge bodily strength to the aid of every thing that required
it, and who was good-natured as a Newfoundland dog.</p>

<p>The housewife was so occupied with the pretty strife under the apple
tree that she did not hear a knock at the front door, and was quite
taken by surprise when the help flung open that leading to the porch,
and revealed two strange men standing in the hall behind her.</p>

<p>When the door was opened, shouts of laughter swept through it from the
orchard, and one of the men, without heeding the lady, passed by her,
saying:</p>

<p>"Excuse me! It is my child&mdash;my little daughter!" and with quick strides
he advanced toward the apple tree, leaving his companion behind.</p>

<p>"Don't be skeered nor nothing, marm," said Rice, looking eagerly toward
the apple tree. "It's his little darter, and he's just found out where
she is, arter a tough siege among the niggers in St. Domingo, where we
thought he was left dead. I seed him fall down like an ox with the blow
of an axe, among a hull swarm of 'em in the cellar of one of them St.
Domingo houses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span> and arterward I saw 'em carry him off to be buried.
They took him up into the mountains, marm, and his goodness saved his
life arter all; for one of the niggers that he'd saved from a flogging
once knew him, and when the rest wanted to kill him over agin, this 'ere
chap jest begged him off and took him away to his own hut and kinder
nussed him up, you see; but it was a good while afore he got well, and
he had a tough time getting away&mdash;had to take a vessel going 'round the
Horn."</p>

<p>The minister had been disturbed by the knock which his wife had failed
to hear, and now stood in the back door listening to this rapid
narrative with a look of wonder in his face, while his wife sat with her
breath suspended, and the color dying gradually from her cheek, appalled
by the first glimpse of a crime in which she felt almost like a
participant.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Captain Mason reached the apple tree, and paused a few feet
from Rose, with his arms extended, striving to call out, "My daughter,
my daughter," but the words died on his lips, and broke up in tears;
thus he stood before the child trembling like a criminal, and with his
noble features all in a tumult of tender agitation.</p>

<p>Rose had just succeeded in coaxing the apple from Paul, and tossing it
into the air, was intent on catching it with her hands, but her eyes
fell upon the stranger, and the sight seemed to harden her into stone.
The apple fell through her half-lifted hands, the laughter froze on her
lips, and her blue eyes opened wide and wild.</p>

<p>"Rose, my own little Rose, have you forgotten me so soon?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
The child uttered a faint wail; her hands fell down; she stood before
him like a flower withering at the stalk.</p>

<p>"Father! oh, father!"</p>

<p>The words came forth in a cry of pain, yet joy shone in her face.</p>

<p>He knelt down on the grass and folded her close to his heart, raining
kisses on her forehead, her hair, and her pretty hands. "My child, my
child," he murmured, with eager tenderness. "She is frightened. She
believed me dead. She has not had time to be glad. Oh, Rose, it is your
father; kiss me, kiss me, little Rose."</p>

<p>The child trembled in his arms, but reached up her lips and kissed him
over and over again.</p>

<p>"Now," said Mason, putting her away from his bosom, and examining her
with tears of proud fondness in his eye, "now, my little Rose, go with
me to your mother; is she in the house?"</p>

<p>Again that shiver came over the child; she bent her eyes to the earth,
and seemed to wither under his look.</p>

<p>"Oh, father, father, don't."</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Rose&mdash;why are you afraid? Come, come, go with me to
your mother."</p>

<p>"Mother isn't here," faltered the child.</p>

<p>A look of keen disappointment swept Mason's face. "Not here! Not with
her child! Then, where is she?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, father, indeed I don't; she would marry Captain Thrasher,
and go away. I begged and begged her not to; but she would do it."</p>

<p>Rose began to cry bitterly, in the midst of these words. Captain Mason
put her away with horror.</p>

<p>"Would marry Captain Thrasher! Captain Thrasher!" He spoke in a hoarse
whisper, as if the words chilled him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
"Oh, I couldn't help it!" pleaded poor Rose, dropping on her knees, and
holding up both hands like an infant Samuel.</p>

<p>"No, sir; Rose tells the truth. She tried and tried, but madame would
go," said Paul, dropping on one knee by Rose, and pleading for her with
his eyes. "That bad man came after madame, and put my mother's jewels on
her neck. It was them which carried her away from Rose."</p>

<p>"Married to Captain Thrasher!" The words came forth hoarsely from his
white lips. "My wife!"</p>

<p>Rice came up at the moment, looking fierce and agitated.</p>

<p>"Come away, captin, come away; this isn't no place for us," he said. "I
will search the rascal out, though he were hid away in the icebergs of
the frozen ocean. I'll neither eat nor sleep till he's handcuffed and
shackled down in jail."</p>

<p>"Is this thing true, Rice?" inquired Mason, in a deadly whisper.</p>

<p>"True as the gospel, captin. He married 'em both&mdash;your wife and my
sister. Oh!"</p>

<p>The sailor ground his teeth, and clenched his hand until it looked like
a mass of iron.</p>

<p>"Married to your sister?"</p>

<p>"Yes, captin; it was his name she wouldn't give up. She sot there on the
gallows with that marriage writing in her bosom, and let the women sneer
at her without a word, all to save that villain from disgrace. When she
fainted away in my arms after they took her down, the old woman found
this a lying agin her heart. I took it out, and swore an oath to search
the sarpent out; but his father told me that he'd gone off on a whaling
ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span> afore she was took up, and didn't know nothing about it, so I
waited. But I'm on his track now. He's on this 'ere continent, and I'll
find him, or die on the hunt. Don't look so skeered, little Paul; you
haint got nothing to do with this; so you needn't look at a chap in that
'ere pitiful way, no how. I aint mad with you, if I didn't shake hands."</p>

<p>"But Rose, poor Rose," pleaded the boy.</p>

<p>Rice looked kindly on the little girl. "Poor gal, poor little critter,"
he muttered, shaking his head; "but what is her suffering to his'n, I
should like to know. If his heart isn't broke, I don't know the signs.
Come, captin, don't look so down in the mouth; we've both got a job
afore us, and had better be a doing uv it."</p>

<p>Mason stood with his back to the group, gazing heavily on the earth.</p>

<p>"She thought I was dead; he told her so; and, perhaps, believed it. The
wretch persecuted her before she was married. She was alone and
destitute&mdash;a widow&mdash;very proud, and so helpless. Poor Ellen."</p>

<p>"Come, captin, my heart burns like a live coal. I long to be after the
villain," said Rice.</p>

<p>"Be after him&mdash;oh, yes; but where? He is your sister's husband&mdash;that
paper proves it. Legally married&mdash;and yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused&mdash;cold shudders crept through his frame&mdash;tears of agony heaved
his chest&mdash;then the might of his grief broke forth, and covering his
face with both hands, he wept like a little child.</p>

<p>"Captin&mdash;Captin Mason, I say, look up&mdash;don't, don't&mdash;I can't stand it,"
cried Rice. "It's bad enough to see a woman cry; but this 'ere is more
than I can bear, darn me if it aint."</p>

<br />
<span class="sub">MARRIED AGAIN.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Captain Mason</span> removed his hands, and turned his face, white and
tear-stained, upon his friend.</p>

<p>"Rice, I loved that woman."</p>

<p>"True enough, captin; but don't think about that; there are as good fish
in the sea as ever were taken out. Jest let us get hold of that
scoundrel. We've got him tight now. This 'ere thing of marrying two
wives is biggermy, and all the lawyers in Connecticut couldn't keep a
man from State's prison if that 'ere crime is brought agin him. Come on,
captin, I'll expose him."</p>

<p>"And Ellen&mdash;the mother of my child!" said Mason, sadly.</p>

<p>Rice took off his hat, and began to brush it with the sleeve of his
coat.</p>

<p>"Yes, captin, I'm afeard we couldn't do one without the other; but the
woman desarves it."</p>

<p>"Rice, Rice, her child is looking at you."</p>

<p>"And my sister is moaning her heart out in Simsbury Mines&mdash;my innocent
sister. If the court had known that she was a married woman it wouldn't
have been so hard with her. It was to get rid of her disgrace, they
said, that she killed her child. If they had but known that there wasn't
no disgrace she wouldn't have been sent to that prison. Mebby, if I was
to show this certificate to the governor now, he'd let her out, and put
Thrasher in her place."</p>

<p>Mason looked at him with heavy eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
"His guilt would do nothing to prove her innocent; and she, the woman
who was my wife, had no share in this guilt; but the disgrace will fall
on her. She believed herself a widow."</p>

<p>"And was in a mighty hurry to get clear of the name," muttered Rice,
under his breath.</p>

<p>Mason did not hear him, but had relapsed into the pain of his thoughts.
Meantime, Jube had come slowly down from the apple tree, and stood
before them, smiling and softly rubbing his hands. This cheerful
unconsciousness of every thing but joy, at seeing his best friends, in
the negro, was a new pang to Mason. He spoke kindly to the poor fellow,
and that was all. In a moment he had relapsed into gloom again. Paul
pulled Jube by his garments, and drew him on one side. When the two came
back Jube's face was sombre like the rest. He could not comprehend the
entire case, but knew that some wrong had been done to his benefactor,
and this wounded his heart to the core.</p>

<p>Rice came closer to Mason, and drew him aside.</p>

<p>"Captin, will it make you happier if I let this villain go, and never
say a word about it?"</p>

<p>Mason started.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Rice. I am so bewildered nothing seems real; not even my
child there."</p>

<p>"I can search him out. He's in this country, that I feel sure about.
They must be living together somewhere, either in York State or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mason started as if an adder had stung him.</p>

<p>"Living together!"</p>

<p>There was fire enough in his heart then. It flashed from his eyes, and
made every nerve in his body tremble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
"Living together!" he repeated, with sickening pain. "Tear them apart,
Rice. She has no moral guilt now, but it may come to that. Tear him from
her side. He is your sister's husband&mdash;she <i>was</i> my wife! Drag them
asunder! I could not see her living with that man, without tearing him
all to pieces! No, no; if the choice is guilt or disgrace, let the shame
come. I can bear it. My little girl&mdash;God help us&mdash;she can bear it."</p>

<p>Rose began to cry, and creeping up to her father, nestled her little
hand in his.</p>

<p>"Don't, father; she'll come back again, if you only ask her!"</p>

<p>Mason grasped the little hand till Rose almost cried out with the pain,
but she was a brave child, and gave no sign that she was hurt.</p>

<p>At last Mason addressed Rice more composedly, but still in a trembling
voice.</p>

<p>"Where was this thing done, Rice?"</p>

<p>"In that house. The minister himself married them. All the family saw
it, Jube and Paul among the rest."</p>

<p>"Is there a register?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you can read it."</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>They went into the house together, slowly, like men walking at a
funeral. Jube and the children followed with downcast looks, wondering
what terrible thing had happened, when Rose ought to be so glad now that
her father had come back.</p>

<p>The minister and his little wife were in great trouble when their guests
came back to the house, she had evidently been weeping, and really felt
as if some inevitable disgrace had fallen upon the sacred character of
her husband. He was terribly bewildered, and with the fragments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span> of a
half finished sermon in his head, found great difficulty in
comprehending the true state of the case. When it really got fastened on
his intelligence, the shock was powerful in its effects; he could not be
persuaded that some stain might not rest upon him, and that he ought not
on the very next Sunday to acknowledge himself a grave sinner before the
entire congregation.</p>

<p>It was a sad visit, both to the father and child. At the moment they
sprang to each
<a name="other2" id="other2"></a><ins title="Original has others'">other's</ins> embrace, this fearful intelligence
had thrust them apart, and after this, all their endearments were given
in tears. Rose felt as if there were something wrong in claiming the
caresses of her own father, and it seemed as though her little heart
would break when he put her aside, afraid that she would be terrified by
the groans that no effort of his could entirely suppress.</p>

<p>They parted in sadness, for years, if not for ever. During all her sweet
girlhood, the minister's wife was all the mother Rose must henceforth
know; as for the father, how bitterly did he regret the kindness which
had spared his life, and healed his wounds among the negroes of St.
Domingo. What was he now but a wronged, desolate man, worse than
widowed, worse than childless, for to him the very memory of affection
had become a pain.</p>

<p>As they went from the house, Rice wrung his captain's hand. "You will
let me punish the man?" he said, pleading for the justice that was his
by right.</p>

<p>"Punish him, but spare her&mdash;spare my child. Separate them quietly; and
if it must be&mdash;if she is not willing to leave him&mdash;tell her that I am
alive. If she falls dead at your feet, tell her the truth. But if she
gives him up, leave her in peace."</p>

<a name="lxv" id="lxv"></a>CHAPTER LXV.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">THE FANCY BALL.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> result of Mrs. Mason's latest reconciliation with the man she
honestly believed to be her husband, was soon made visible in more
lavish expenditure, and a display in her entertainments never attempted
before.</p>

<p>An exuberant taste kept her always on the alert. The constant suggestion
of some extravagant novelty became an habitual stimulant, now that home
affection had become a hopeless thing with her.</p>

<p>During the season of moroseful discontent which we have described,
Nelson had checked this wanton craving for display by less liberal
supplies of money; but now that he was grateful and generous again, the
fever burst forth in new vigor. One of her fashionable friends had just
given a fancy ball, where the flowers alone cost a little fortune. Mrs.
Nelson was not to be distanced thus in extravagance. She would give an
entertainment before which that of her rival should wither into
insignificance, like the roses swept from her banqueting hall the
morning after that great triumph. This had been a leading motive for the
interview described in another chapter. With a few smiles and caressing
words she had won a new hold upon the purse, which opened grudgingly
only when she grew neglectful or insolent by a repletion of her wishes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nelson's rival had given a fancy ball at one of the principal
watering-places, which certainly had proved the great success of the
season. She would do something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span> better than that. Her ball should rival
royalty. It should be quoted in our republican society as the charming
entertainments of Maria Antoinette, in her little palace in the Park at
Versailles, became the conversation of all France.</p>

<p>The weather was lovely. Summer had just melted into the golden autumn.
The atmosphere was delicious with fruity odors, in which the breath of
late flowers mingled in sensuous richness. This was the season for her
grand effort. Society had just come back from the springs and the
fashionable watering-places, eager for something new. Her friends should
be gratified; nay, astonished. She would throw that entire mansion open.
Its rich draperies, its statues and bronzes, the frescoed ceilings, and
rare pictures. All should flash upon the world at once. She would
illuminate the grounds, weigh down the old forest trees with a fruitage
of lights, build pavilions and rustic bridges. Nothing should be omitted
to turn her residence into a paradise.</p>

<p>This was all accomplished. As if to crown her triumph, a moon, just
swelling from its crescent, came out among the bright stars, and shone
with peculiar radiance that evening. Every thing smiled upon this woman.
Officious menials in livery crowded her halls&mdash;her supper room was one
bower of blossoms; delicious fruits nestled in them, and mingled still
more ruddy tints with their bloom; cut-glass shone through their leaves
like gushes of water; silver glittered through them like frost work; and
heavy garlands clambered up the pillars that supported the frescoed
ceiling, forming light colonnades on each side, where mirrors reflected
every thing, as lovely landscapes are seen sleeping in a lake&mdash;the
shadows more beautiful than the substance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
Down from her dressing-room, rustling in white silk, embroidered with
silver flowers, that shimmered like moonlight among the heavy folds,
came the mistress of this festival, superb in her own beauty, with
jewels flashing on her bare neck and arms, and lighting up her heavy
tresses like clustering stars.</p>

<p>Nelson met her on the broad staircase. He was grave and sad. These
ostentatious entertainments were against his taste, and always
displeased him. This evening a heavier weight than usual fell upon his
spirits; even the rare loveliness of his wife failed to win a smile to
his lips.</p>

<p>She held out her hand, smiling radiantly upon him. Her triumph was
certain. Nothing like the scene that broke upon her through the open
door had met her eye before. She could afford to smile on the man whose
gold had opened this paradise to her ambition. He made no response, but
sighing heavily, turned at her request and walked by her side through
the sumptuous rooms. She was exultant; the effect surpassed her
expectations. The tread of her silken-clad feet on the marble floor and
moss-like carpets was like that of an empress, but it annoyed her that
Nelson took no part in her joy. She observed that he turned away with
uneasiness whenever she lifted her arm to point out a beautiful object
or some peculiar effect. She did not know that the flash of those jewels
which clasped her snow-white arm was like the glitter of a serpent to
him. A thousand times he had wished those diamonds at the bottom of the
ocean.</p>

<p>Those jewels reminded him of so much that he would have given worlds to
forget. They brought to his mind that palace home at Port au Prince,
where he had stolen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span> at night in search of the treasures which, in the
end, tempted that woman to become his wife. He remembered the horrid
scene in that cellar. He remembered the descent of Captain Mason upon
him just as he was breaking open the vault where the wealth of many a
rich man lay buried&mdash;the honest indignation of that noble face&mdash;the cold
protest. Then the crowd of negro fiends that rushed upon them, reeling
with drunkenness, gnashing their white teeth, and emitting gleams of
hatred from their bloodshot eyes. He remembered how the crowbar had
fallen from his hands, and felt anew the thrill with which he had
pointed out Captain Mason to the vengeance of these demons.</p>

<p>No wonder he shuddered and turned away sick with loathing of the jewels.
By eternal tortures, such as pressed upon him now, he had bought them,
and, through them, the woman whose cold beauty they adorned.</p>

<p>They were the embodiment of his crimes. Why would she wear them? Could
she not guess that every rainbow flash that came from her person filled
his brain with pictures of blood? Would she never permit him to forget
the riot of that awful night, when the brave man, whose wife she had
been, was dragged lifeless along the muddy floor of the cellar, and
carried off to be flung in the heaps of slain humanity which blocked up
the streets of Port au Prince after the carnage which makes men shudder
yet, even in remembrance?</p>

<p>She wanted him to be happy, and yet persisted in wearing those things.
True, he had never dared to object, they were hers. He had bought her
with them; what excuse could he make for the loathing with which he
regarded their display?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
She saw the pallor of his countenance and laughed.</p>

<p>"How strange," she said, surveying herself in a mirror, and changing one
of the ornaments in her hair, "how strange, Nelson, that you never can
accustom yourself to society. The very expectation of doing the honors
of your own house to a fashionable crowd makes a coward of you; while
I&mdash;well, it is true we ladies do adapt ourselves to circumstances better
than men. Confess this, husband, and I will permit you to tie the laces
of this slipper; see, they have broken loose."</p>

<p>Nelson, still grave and sad, dropped on one knee, and tied the laces
around that exquisitely turned ankle. She laughed at his awkwardness,
and spurned him playfully with her foot when the task was done.</p>

<p>"Come, now, I hear a carriage. It is early, but our guests are
impatient, I suppose. No wonder; it is not often they will see any thing
like this. Come, you must help me receive, or people will think I am
ashamed of my husband."</p>

<h2><a name="lxvi" id="lxvi"></a>CHAPTER LXVI.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">STRANGE GUESTS.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">She</span> was very playful and charming that night. He looked into her eyes as
they flashed down upon him, and forgot the jewels. They walked together
into the vast drawing-rooms, and waited for the guests, whose footsteps
could be heard plainly on the marble floor of the entrance hall. The
steps were heavy, and seemed out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span> of place in that dwelling. The master
of all that splendor was strangely impressed by the sound of those
footsteps. His breath came slowly and his restless eyes sought the door
with a species of vague dread in their glance.</p>

<p>His wife stood careless and smiling, always graceful and ready to enjoy
the surprise of her first guests. They came forward slowly, the heavy
footsteps smothered in the carpets, and looking around in vague wonder,
as if frightened at finding themselves in the midst of such splendor.</p>

<p>"Who can they be, dressed in that fashion?" muttered the lady. "I do not
know them!"</p>

<p>Nelson watched the two men anxiously as they approached. They were
strangers, and certainly could not be invited guests. The men saw him,
and advanced up the room.</p>

<p>"Is your name Nelson?" inquired the foremost, speaking almost in a
whisper, for he was awed by the splendor around him.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Nelson; "that is my name."</p>

<p>"Nelson Thrasher?"</p>

<p>The woman by his side gave a little scream as the words fell on her ear,
but controlled herself instantly, though the smile left her lips, and
the gorgeous fan trembled in her grasp.</p>

<p>"Yes," said a third person, coming up the room with a heavy, rolling
gate, such as seafaring men attain in long voyages. "It is Nelson
Thrasher. Arrest him here and now."</p>

<p>Every vestige of color left Thrasher's face&mdash;he stood trembling before
the two men like a coward. But the woman by his side drew her
magnificent figure to its proudest height, and turned scornfully upon
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
"You are mistaken; his name is not Thrasher. This gentleman is my
husband!"</p>

<p>The seafaring man looked at her steadily; there was nothing in her words
or appearance to excite compassion, so he spoke out bluntly.</p>

<p>"No, marm, <i>you</i> are mistaken. His name is Thrasher, and he is not your
husband, having been married to another woman long before you left the
pine woods."</p>

<p>The color fled from her proud face, till the jewels, flashing their
light across it, gave her features the appearance of marble. She turned
upon Thrasher with deadly hate in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Is this thing true?" The words hissed through her white lips.</p>

<p>He did not answer, but stood before her dumb and sullen.</p>

<p>"Is this thing true?" she repeated, turning to the sailor.</p>

<p>"True as judgment, marm."</p>

<p>"And the woman, her name, I say!"</p>

<p>"His wife is my own sister, Katharine Allen."</p>

<p>"His wife!" she cried, fiercely turning upon Thrasher again. "Man, have
you nothing to say?"</p>

<p>Thrasher lifted his eyes, heavy and sad as death. "I loved you, Ellen."</p>

<p>"Loved me!"</p>

<p>The bitter scorn in her voice made him shrink like a hound when it feels
the lash.</p>

<p>"It is the truth. God only knows how I loved you, how I do love you."</p>

<p>Her face fairly contracted with the loathing that had slept in her bosom
so long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
"And God only knows how I hate you&mdash;how I hated you then, and shall
forever and ever."</p>

<p>"But you married me."</p>

<p>"No, I married these, and these, and these!"</p>

<p>She dashed one hand against the jewels on her bosom, hair, and arms,
then pointed to the supper room, with its flowers, and the long vista of
saloons opening into each other.</p>

<p>Thrasher shrunk into himself, standing before her white and cold. She
had no mercy on his wretchedness; no control over her own rage.</p>

<p>"Take him away," she said, addressing the men. "If you have a warrant,
use it quickly. Drag him from my sight, anywhere, so that he is taken
far enough, and buried deep enough."</p>

<p>"Ellen! Ellen!"</p>

<p>The cry of his anguish would have touched a stone with mercy, but she
only drew a sob, and went on, bitter as death, and sharp as steel. He
knew that venomous truth was spiking up through her rage, and while she
was treading him to the earth, the viper in his nature crested itself
against her.</p>

<p>"You married me for these," he said, pointing to her bosom, which heaved
with rage under its flaming ornaments. "I may be guilty, but not more
guilty than you are, Ellen."</p>

<p>"Take him away&mdash;take him away," she cried, "or I shall die."</p>

<p>"One moment," exclaimed Thrasher, desperately; "Ellen speak to me alone.
It may be my last request."</p>

<p>Had she been alone, I think the woman would have refused him&mdash;but with
all those eyes turned upon her, she could only step aside to one of
those little boudoirs that his wealth had fitted up for her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
"Well?" she said, haughtily turning upon him as he stood before her,
pale and shrinking.</p>

<p>"Ellen&mdash;Ellen, do not be so cruel to me; if I have sinned, it was from
the love that made me desperate. If I have wronged you, think what I
gave up for your sake&mdash;how much I risked&mdash;how much I have endured."</p>

<p>"Well?" she repeated, growing hard and stern with each word, "what
more?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Ellen," he pleaded, "unsay those cutting words, they pierce me to
the heart&mdash;never loved me&mdash;hate&mdash;oh, do not strike me so hard!"</p>

<p>"Hate!" sneered the woman. "No, no, that is not the word, it does not
express enough; I want a stronger language, something that will combine
loathing, detestation, and scorn, all in one word, that I may fling it
at you, and go!"</p>

<p>"Ellen, Ellen!"</p>

<p>She took no heed of this agonized cry, but went on, her cheeks blanched,
and her eyes aflame with passion. "The only drop of comfort I have," she
raved, "is, that I can for once speak out, and throw off the load of
hate that has fevered every drop of blood in my veins since the day I
married you."</p>

<p>He did not attempt to answer her now. The scathing words she had uttered
seemed to freeze the life from his whole system. He stood looking upon
her with wild, dreary eyes, his whole face so coldly white that she
paused, drawing a sharp breath, even in the headlong passion that
possessed her.</p>

<p>At last he spoke, but the hollow sound of his voice made her shiver.</p>

<p>"You hate me&mdash;and I, who loved you better than truth, better than honor,
better than my own soul&mdash;hate you, Ellen Mason!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
She was petrified. The fearful violence of her passion had borne her too
far&mdash;fallen as he was, the man possessed power. There was his secret;
with all her patient craft she had failed to win that, and now it would
be buried with him in the prison to which he must inevitably go. She
looked keenly in his face; it was hard as granite, and his eyes seemed
scarcely human from the fire that smouldered in them, giving dusky force
to the circles underneath. She knew that at last her power had been
wholly swept away. She saw this with a pang. The whole scene had come
upon her so suddenly, that she could not yet realize her true
position&mdash;that he was not, and never had been her husband; that before
the world she was a disgraced woman. She remembered, with a thrill of
terror, how the measures taken only to protect her pride, and save her
from the intrusions of Thrasher's family, would now tell against her.
The name partially suppressed, the false history of her position, all
would go to prove complicity with the criminal whom she had just
exasperated into a bitter enemy.</p>

<p>Stung with this conviction, she stood before Thrasher in the full
humiliation of a haughty spirit overthrown.</p>

<p>A stern sneer crept to his lips as he looked upon her. He turned and
moved toward the door.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" she questioned, in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>"I am going to proclaim myself a criminal, and you Captain Mason's
widow!" he said.</p>

<p>"To whom?"</p>

<p>"To your guests as they come in!"</p>

<p>"You will not be so cruel!"</p>

<p>He laughed like a fiend.</p>

<p>"Cruel!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
"So base, then!"</p>

<p>"Base! I bought you with money; sold myself for love&mdash;both were
cheated!"</p>

<p>He passed out of the room, smiling upon her as he went. She was a
sharp-willed woman, crafty and prompt. The danger was imminent, but she
had the intellect to meet it. Quick as lightning her plan was matured.
She followed him out, and touching one of the officers on the arm,
whispered:</p>

<p>"A hundred dollars in gold if you get that man clear of the house in ten
minutes."</p>

<p>"Can't be done, marm. Mr. Rice has gone for more help. No moving a peg
till he comes back."</p>

<p>"But you can lock him up; put a guard over him; do something to save us
from this disgrace! If one hundred is not enough you shall have five!"</p>

<p>"But where shall we put him&mdash;every room in the house seems turned into a
garden?"</p>

<p>"In the south wing, along that hall, you will find a room. It has but
one door. Iron shutters are concealed under the ornamental work. Secure
them, and it is impossible for him to escape. Hark! that is a carriage!
A thousand dollars if you get him off before it reaches the entrance!"</p>

<p>She was pale as death, and her whispers sounded like the hiss of a
reptile.</p>

<p>The two men consulted together a moment, and directly one of them
touched Thrasher on the arm.</p>

<p>"Come, go with us into another room."</p>

<p>"What room?"</p>

<p>"That in the south wing, with iron shutters and only one door. It will
do."</p>

<p>"No," he said, doggedly; "my house isn't a prison.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span> You have a warrant,
execute it. I will pass those people as they come in."</p>

<p>The men began to expostulate. Ellen Mason trembled with terror, for the
carriage was already setting down its burden at her door.</p>

<p>One of the men came to her for counsel.</p>

<p>"Shall we take him away by force, marm?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if it must be&mdash;quick."</p>

<p>To her surprise, Thrasher came forward. The expression of his face had
changed&mdash;there was a gleam of malicious triumph in it.</p>

<p>"Madame," he said, "I consent to remain your guest a little longer."
Then, turning to the men, he said: "How many hours shall I be detained
in this room with one door and iron shutters?"</p>

<p>"All night," replied the man.</p>

<p>"All night?" There was something more than a question in his voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; we shan't run the risk of taking you out in a crowd&mdash;depend
on it. Too smart a chap for any risks of that sort."</p>

<p>"No chance of getting off before morning?" he questioned again, very
earnestly.</p>

<p>"Not the ghost of one&mdash;even if Rice himself comes back. We have all the
responsibility."</p>

<p>"Well, I am ready. Farewell, madame."</p>

<p>Ellen Mason followed him, with affrighted looks. Her guests were coming
up the entrance hall in groups. Thrasher stood immovable, smiling
maliciously upon her. This exasperated the two officers, and they seized
him each by an arm. He shook them off at once, and moved close to the
lady.</p>

<p>"Ellen Mason, if I leave you one more night of triumph,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span> it is because
the blow that I strike shall be for life, not for an hour."</p>

<p>She drew back, and stood, with a forced smile in her eyes, looking
toward the advancing guests. He, too, smiled, and walked on, bowing low
as he passed the groups of revellers that now half filled the entrance
hall. The two officers rushed eagerly after him, and seized him by the
arms in the midst of his guests. Again he shook them off, and, turning
toward the south wing, disappeared.</p>

<p>With a wild glitter in her eyes, the mistress of the mansion watched him
till he was lost in the incoming crowd. Then drawing a heavy breath, she
turned to receive the brilliant throng that surged into her rooms.</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="lxvii" id="lxvii"></a>CHAPTER LXVII.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">TOGETHER, YET SEPARATED.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Directly</span>, that magnificent suite of rooms was full. The house had given
up its gay company group by group, when the vast apartments overflowed,
and the illuminated grounds grew brilliant as fairy land. It was
remarked that Mrs. Nelson had never received with such queenly grace
before. That superb toilet surpassed her usual sumptuousness; the glow
of her jewels scarcely matched the wild light that came and went in her
eyes. Her spirits were unusually brilliant throughout the whole
entertainment; the scarlet of excitement burned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span> on her cheeks; she
seemed lifted out of herself by the success of this unique fete.</p>

<p>This was the general opinion of her guests. They could account for the
brilliant beauty of her presence in no other way.</p>

<p>How could strangers guess at the quivering fear that trembled at her
heart when any unusual noise arose in the crowd which surrounded her
with flattery and soft adulation? How was it possible for them to know
that the brilliant beauty of her face was lighted by the fever of
anxiety so terrible that her heart quailed under it.</p>

<p>A few of the guests remarked upon the absence of Mr. Nelson. At first
she evaded these inquiries, but, as the evening drew near its close, she
whispered to one of her most intimate friends a secret that soon spread
through the vast crowd:</p>

<p>Mr. Nelson was insane. The men that had been remarked with him in the
hall were his keepers. The malady had been growing upon him for months,
and could be kept secret no longer. She had done her best to conceal it,
but of late his eccentricities had become so uncontrollable that a
private asylum had been decided on. This it was which had made her so
restless and excited all the evening. People thought it high spirits,
but alas! how little the world knows of human suffering.</p>

<p>It had been against her will that the party had gone on. Indeed, her
husband's malady had never become really violent until after the
invitations were given out, but he was quite unfit to appear. It was a
great affliction, but Mrs. Nelson was afraid of her life, and had with
painful reluctance compelled herself to consign her dear husband
entirely into medical hands. Early in the morning he would leave home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
These were the remarks which floated from lip to lip when the guests
broke into groups after supper, and the dear friends who had met the
lady of the mansion with congratulations, left with compassionate words
of consolation, which she received with gentle grace, more attractive
than her previous high spirits had been.</p>

<p>Ellen Mason was a magnificent actress&mdash;few women on the stage ever went
through a difficult <i>role</i> so triumphantly. But when her guests were all
gone, the facts of her position came upon her mind with bitter force.
She looked around on the luxurious ruin of the supper table, the
withered garlands, the groups of glasses stained with amber, or ruddy
wine, the broken pyramids, and silver baskets, heaped with dying flowers
and rejected fruit, with a feeling of absolute disgust. The glittering
confusion made her faint. She longed to rush by the servants, who were
closing the house, and seek the open air, late as it was. This impulse
seized upon her with such force that she gathered up the scarf of
Brussels point, which had fallen like frost-work over her dress, and
vailing her head with it, stepped through an open window into the
grounds.</p>

<p>The moon was down, but hundreds of colored lamps still burned in the
trees, looking only the more brilliant from the deep shadows that lay in
the leaves. The cool night air chilled the fever in her veins and gave
her more vivid power of reflection. There is no time when the emptiness
of fashionable life strikes the mind so forcibly as that which follows a
successful entertainment. The ruins of a feast are always oppressive.</p>

<p>The hollowness of her whole life struck Ellen Mason full upon the heart.
What was she after all but a gross impostor forced to work out the
problem of her own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span> falsehood without help? She began to realize the
insufficiency of all that had been gained to her life. She thought of
the honest love that had made her humble home in the pine wood so
pleasant. In that home how often had she thought of scenes like the one
before her, and longed to act a part in them. But these had been only
dreams. They had never deepened to ambitious hopes till Thrasher came
with his brilliant temptations and won her from that honest roof. What a
worthless life hers had proved since then! would it always be so? had
she tied herself forever and ever to all this emptiness? Would she
indeed be permitted to revel still among these golden husks? That man
had threatened her with his speech and more fiercely still with his
eyes. Oh, how she dreaded him.</p>

<p>Lost in these thoughts she sat down on a garden chair, and clasping both
hands in her lap, began to cry. This was an unusual weakness. She had
wept when the news of her husband's death came, but seldom since then.
Vanity thrives best in the sunshine, tears are unnecessary to its
growth. And now Ellen Mason's life was all vanity.</p>

<p>But Ellen wept now. The excitement of the evening had left her in a
state of utter exhaustion. She gathered the lace scarf over her eyes,
and it fell away damp, like a cobweb heavy with dew.</p>

<p>A slight noise upon the turf made her look up with some impatience. What
servant had dared to follow and disturb her?</p>

<p>It was no servant, but a tall man, with the light from a cluster of
lamps lying full upon his face. She arose, stood upright a moment, and
fell back again, her lips apart, her eyes closed tight, as if to shut
out some terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span> object. Her lips trembled as if words were struggling
through them, but they gave forth no sound, and she fell away with her
head resting against the hard iron fruit and clustering leaves of the
garden chair.</p>

<p>The man drew close to her side, when he found that she was insensible,
and bent over her with a countenance full of unutterable grief. There
she lay beneath his eyes like a broken statue. The mother of his
child&mdash;the wife of his youth, with the burning shame of a second and
illegal marriage flashing from the jewels on her bosom and in her hair.
But she was the mother of his child, the object of his first and only
love, and that pale, cold face was wet with tears. His own hands had
aided in separating her from that man. It was a solemn duty, but he had
no wish of revenge beyond that. This task accomplished he would go away
and struggle against his bereavement as a strong man should. He had not
expected, nor perhaps wished to see that woman's face again, but as it
lay beneath his gaze so like death, something of the solemn tenderness
which death claims came over him. It was not love. It was not
forgiveness&mdash;he had never condemned her enough for that&mdash;but the wronged
man could not forget that she had been his wife, and that great sorrow
and bitter shame had fallen upon her that night. He knelt upon the
grass, and lifting her head from its iron resting-place, drew it to his
bosom. The heart beneath scarcely quickened a pulse. To him she was not
a living woman, but a memory that had turned to marble under his eyes
and lay like marble against his heart.</p>

<p>It was terrible to see a human being so perfectly lifeless and yet feel
that vitality existed in the pulseless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span> heart. He did not touch that
forehead with his lips, but passed one hand tenderly over it, muttering:</p>

<p>"Poor Ellen&mdash;poor lost Ellen."</p>

<p>She did not move; his words failed to reach her. He felt how cold she
was growing, and lifting her in his arms carried her into the house; for
the window through which she had passed was still open, the light of a
chandelier poured through it, and was exhausted in the flower beds
underneath.</p>

<p>In passing through the shrubbery the lace scarf caught on a rose-bush
and was torn in fragments. He remembered how the drapery which had
shrouded Paul's mother had been swept from the dead, and sighed heavily,
as if composing this one also for the grave.</p>

<p>Mason passed through the window and stood in the little breakfast room,
which has already been described. Through the open doors he caught a
glimpse of the supper room, from which the scent of luscious fruits and
dying flowers came with sickening force. On the other hand was a long
vista of drawing-rooms, with the lights half extinguished, and a host of
glittering objects visible through the semi-darkness, as lightning
breaks through a cloud surcharged with electricity.</p>

<p>A sadness like that of death fell upon Mason as he saw these things.
They told, in one glance, the history of her involuntary sin. Why should
he wait there to cover her with new anguish and more living shame when
life came back? He laid her down among the silken cushions of a couch
whose crimson warmth only made her face more deathly, and went away
forever. What more was there for him to do? Already he had persuaded
Rice to spare that proud woman the last humiliation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span> of her rashness,
and keep her name, as it was now recognized, out of all legal
proceedings necessary to the conviction of Nelson Thrasher. Beyond this,
magnanimity itself was powerless.</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="lxviii" id="lxviii"></a>CHAPTER LXVIII.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">THE TREASURE VAULT.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Meantime</span> Thrasher entered the room which had always been considered as
particularly his own. The officers, went after him, found out the iron
shutters, and fastened them securely. Then looking complacently around
this impromptu prison, they went into the hall, locking the door
securely outside.</p>

<p>Thrasher sat down in his easy chair, and leaning one hand on the table,
waited patiently till they were gone. When all was quiet, he got up,
crossed the room softly, and drew a couple of bolts, hidden in the
elaborate carving of the door frame. He fastened the shutters in the
same way, so that it was impossible for any one to gain entrance to the
apartment against his desire.</p>

<p>When every thing was safe, he pushed the library table aside, and
kneeling upon the mosaic floor, wheeled the centre ornament from its
place. He descended to a flight of steps that led from the opening, and
with a touch of the finger wheeled the pavement into place again,
closing himself into a deep vault, apparently of solid mason work.
Casks, evidently filled with choice wines, for the name of some rare
vintage was marked on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span> each, were piled on one side of the vault; a rack
filled with bottles rose to the ceiling opposite. It was, after all,
only a wine vault that he had taken so much pains to conceal. This would
have been the first conclusion had any one followed Thrasher into that
recess. But his actions spoke of something more.</p>

<p>Previous to entering the vault, he had lighted a lamp, which he now
placed on the pavement. With a quick wrench of the hand, he swung the
wine rack from its place, and busied himself with one of the slabs of
granite which composed the wall. That too swung open, and exposed an
inner compartment, or square chamber, from which came a flash of
precious metals, and iron-clamped boxes, piled in heaps within. A broad
glow, given back to the light, streamed into the outer vault, filling it
with golden gleams.</p>

<p>Thrasher stepped into the recess, and dragged out a bronze box, scarcely
larger than that which held the jewels entrusted to Captain Mason, and
which now blazed on the person of his wife. He opened this box
carefully, and took out a heavy block of gold, evidently pure metal, but
polished smoothly. It was shaped like a common house brick, and weighed
so heavily that the strong hand of Thrasher sunk under it, and it fell
to the stone floor, giving out a ringing sound that made him start,
notwithstanding all his precautions, and the fact that he was now deep
in the bosom of the earth.</p>

<p>There were many lines of fine engraving on one of the flat surfaces of
the brick; the writing was in French, with which Thrasher seemed
familiar, but he read it over with great care more than once. Then
sitting down, with the brick before him, he took out a graver and began
to cut some rude letters on the opposite side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span> The gold was very soft,
in its pure state, and he made rapid progress; but the record, whatever
it was, took more than two hours in the completion. When it was finished
he dropped the brick into its box, leaving it unlocked. This he placed
just within the mouth of the recess, muttering, "it will be the first
thing to catch the eye."</p>

<p>After this, Thrasher opened another box and took out what seemed, by
their glitter, to be some unset diamonds. These he placed in his bosom.
Then filling his pockets with a weight of the gold coin, he stepped into
the outer vault, swung the granite slab into place, and proceeded to
cement it into the wall with some material which he took from one of the
casks.</p>

<p>When this was accomplished he stole softly up the steps again, let
himself into the upper room, and proceeded to undraw the bolts, which
had given the doors and windows a double fastening. There was nothing
more for him to do. Unconsciously the woman who was his fate, had placed
him in a position to accomplish all that was needful to protect his
wealth, and even if it should be found, to save it from her rapacity.
Once satisfied of this, he became less excited; for during his work,
great drops of perspiration had stood on his forehead, and a wild
eagerness burned in his eyes; now he sat down in his easy chair for the
last time, and sternly awaited the coming of his captors.</p>

<p>About daybreak they opened his prison and took him forth. He turned a
fierce look on the paradise his wild love had created for a woman who
now loaded his misfortunes with scorn, and muttered such bitter words
under his breath that their venom turned his lips white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span> as it passed
them. In these words the last remnant of his love for Ellen Mason went
out, poisoning the sweet breath of the flowers over which it swept.</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="lxix" id="lxix"></a>CHAPTER LXIX.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">SIMSBURY MINES.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the base of Greenstown mountains, in the town of Granby, stands an
old ruin, surrounded perhaps by more fearful associations than any one
spot in the United States. The very tread of a stranger's foot on the
soil arouses painful thoughts, for it awakens the reverberations which
haunt those cavernous ruins, and every sound seems weighed down with
moans, such as were for many years common to the place.</p>

<p>It is an old ruined prison I am writing about&mdash;one of the most terrible
places of confinement ever known to this free country. A copper mine,
which failed to yield its rich metal in the abundance demanded by
capitalists, had been abandoned, and over the caverns hollowed out from
the bosom of the earth, the authorities of Connecticut erected a prison
for criminals. Thank God the place is a ruin now.</p>

<p>Humanity has dragged the wretched sinners from their burrowing places
under ground, and given them at least pure air and the sunshine which
God created alike for the innocent and the guilty. The spot is deathly
silent, but you cannot pass it without an aching heart, for the misery
once crowded in those caverns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span> gathers around the imagination, and
settles upon it in a heavy cloud, surcharged with groans. You know that
human misery has been crowded there in masses, without air to breathe,
or such light as God gives to his meanest animal. You think of this till
the hollows of the mountains seem gorged with groans, and the cry of
suffering souls comes up through the very pores of the earth, making the
wild flowers tremble beneath the doleful misery that grew desperate
beneath their roots.</p>

<p>A group of rambling wooden buildings thrown promiscuously together, at
the foot of a range of hills, standing out bleak and bare, form the
ruthless feature of a lovely landscape. One building, lifted from the
abrupt descent of the mountain by a double terrace of rocks, commanding
a view of the country, which contrasted its rich cultivation, pleasant
homesteads, and well-filled barns with that narrow roof and meagre
belfry, rose beneath the wild beauty of the mountains. This was the
aspect of Newgate built over the Simsbury Mines, at the time Katharine
Allen first recognized it from the highway, which she must not tread
again for eight weary years.</p>

<p>The front building alone was visible. That long attachment which runs
back toward the hills, with its range of narrow windows, and the smaller
buildings crowded against it, lay in shadow, but from the distance there
was something imposing in the uncouth pile. The sun was approaching its
rest, and flung increasing light around the old prison, giving it gleams
of false cheerfulness that never entered its walls.</p>

<p>Katharine, who sat in the heavy country wagon, between her guards,
chained to the seat, and with her delicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span> wrists chafed by the iron
that weighed those little hands down to her lap, looked toward the gaunt
pile with a feeling of sad speculation. Why had she&mdash;an innocent
woman&mdash;been sent to a place like that? for it was terrible, even in the
glory of sunset. In her whole life she had committed no wrong worthy of
more than gentle punishment. Was it not enough that her husband had
abandoned her? that her child was dead? that her name had become a
by-word in the land? Not enough that she had gone through the first and
most bitter portion of her sentence&mdash;had suffered that hour of public
scorn on the gallows at New Haven&mdash;a more terrible penance than if her
life had been exacted, for the memory was with her always? Must the laws
be forever warring at her young life? Was that huge pile to be her home
for eight long years? They would crowd her down among the desperate
criminals who burrowed their lives out in the bosom of that mountain,
and leave her to die there.</p>

<p>But could she die? Would the principles of life ever give way? When the
sentence had been pronounced upon her, and the judge had condemned her
to go through all the forms of an ignominious death without its last
horrible pangs, she had said to herself, "It is well. I shall not live
through that hour. They will not kill me; but I shall drop dead on the
scaffold. It is thus our Lord will be merciful, and save me from all
this misery."</p>

<p>But, alas! we cannot die of our own will. She had outlived that hour,
and now stood before her second fate, and no signs of death came to
snatch her from it. The anguish of this thought broke upon her as her
eyes fell upon that gloomy pile, and she cried out in the depths of her
soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
"My God! my God! why hast thou forsaken me?"</p>

<p>As the cry left her lips, she lifted her chained hands to her face, and
shut out the prison from her sight, moaning because God would not let
her die.</p>

<p>The two men heard this outburst of misery, and looked on each other in
silence. One turned his head aside, and drew the cuff of his coat across
his eyes, and the other spoke sharply to his horses and began to lash
them; but his voice and arm failed, and he, too, turned away his face.</p>

<p>"Look up, my poor gal," he said, at last, pointing toward the mountain
with his whip. "It doesn't look so tarnal gloomy now."</p>

<p>Katharine dropped her hands, and the iron clashed down to her lap again.
The sun was now at its full setting, and flung a thousand gorgeous tints
on the old prison. Its windows sent back a blaze of gold, the cupola
seemed brimming over with crimson radiance, and rich lights slanted down
the terraces of the mountain.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, thoughtfully. "God is everywhere&mdash;even in that place.
If He will not let me die it is because there is work for me to do. I
shall find it among poor souls yonder&mdash;more miserable still than I am,
for they struggle under a weight of guilt; and I&mdash;God help us all. I
shall find some one to tend and comfort there."</p>

<p>Katharine grew resigned under these good thoughts, and a sweet
tranquillity stole into her eyes. She was innocent. God knew that, and
she knew it, for had not her babe gone to Him pure from her own heart?
Why should she question His graciousness? If He permitted her home to be
in that prison, what right had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span> she to rebel against it? In this frame
of mind she entered Newgate.</p>

<p>It was that sad hour which consigned the prisoners, whose toil lay above
ground, to this living tomb, deep in the earth. The crash of hammers and
clank of iron had ceased in the workshops, and the prisoners were
assembled in the main building, ready to descend into the mines in
search of such rest as that terrible place could afford.</p>

<p>The officers of the prison were occupied. Guards leaned idly on their
muskets, and a group of keepers kept strict watch over the terrible
group. They had no time for newcomers, so Katharine stood between her
guards, drooping wearily under her irons, and looked on, forgetting
herself in compassion for those lost wretches.</p>

<p>A trap-door, scarcely large enough to admit a healthy man, led to the
subterranean dungeons. Around this the prisoners crowded, some swearing
fiercely, others laughing in fiendish glee, a few humble and
brokenhearted, all hustling each other like wild animals crowded on a
precipice. The guards and keepers looked on impatiently. The clank of
chains and those haggard prison faces were familiar to them. They were
only impatient to urge the crowd down that narrow passage, and seal the
unhappy wretches deep in the bowels of the earth, when their duty ceased
till morning.</p>

<p>Down through this narrow trap the prisoners forced themselves, cursing
as they went, and jesting at their own misery. At last all had
disappeared save a little band of women in "linsey-woolsey" dresses cut
very scant, who had waited in one corner of the room, under a guard, for
their turn to descend. As they passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span> Katharine, these women lifted
their heavy eyes to her face, too miserable for pity or wonder; but her
beauty and the strange expression of her features made them pause and
look upon her as if they could not believe that she was one of
themselves.</p>

<p>Some formalities passed. Katharine's name, age, and sentence were
written down in the black records of the prison: "Katharine Allen, aged
twenty-two, found guilty of manslaughter in the first degree; sentenced
to sit upon a gallows in the public square of New Haven for one hour,
and serve eight years at hard labor in the State Prison at Simsbury."</p>

<p>Twice as the warden made this record he stopped to look at the prisoner.
Her presence troubled him with vague compassion. He took the irons from
her arms himself, and rubbed the chafed wrists gently with his palm,
muttering, "Poor wretch, poor wretch. It's hard to put her down among
them."</p>

<p>It was not often that this dignitary visited the subterranean prison,
but he called the keeper most remarkable for kindliness of heart and
bade him take her away. His voice was gentle and Katharine looked at him
gratefully, but she was afraid to speak, for while standing near the
trap-door she had seen a keeper strike one of the women who presumed to
answer him.</p>

<p>A rude ladder, which stood almost perpendicular, led from the trap-door
to the dark caverns underneath. At the first glance Katharine drew back
sick and appalled by the black gulf into which they were urging her. The
warden came forward and strove to reassure her, but she trembled
violently and reeled back from the door, holding out her hands with a
piteous cry for mercy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
There was no help for it; she must descend like the rest, sleep and
suffer like the rest, notwithstanding her beauty and the pure magnetism
of her goodness. She clung to the kind hand reached forth by the warden,
and shutting her eyes sunk through the trap and placed her trembling
feet on the ladder. The keeper was just below encouraging her. The iron
lamp which he held only served to make the darkness horrible. The
blackness into which she was passing seemed to cover her soul and body.</p>

<p>At last her feet touched the earth. The skeleton ladder seemed melting
away in the darkness overhead. The keeper's lamp flickered fitfully; a
mouldy scent floated around her. "This," she murmured, "this must,
indeed, be the valley and shadow of death."</p>

<p>The man opened a door sunk into the walls of the cavern, and there was a
rude cell, occupied by a wooden bench, over which some straw was
scattered; a slanting board, also covered with straw, rose a few inches
above the level at one end, and this was all the pillow that beautiful
head would know for eight years. The keeper carried a coarse gray
blanket on his arm, which he laid down on the bench. Katharine took up
the blanket, but her hands trembled so violently that she could not
unfold it. He saw this; set his lamp on the earth, and spread the
blanket over the straw. She tried to thank him, but could not speak.</p>

<p>The lamp light, faint as it was, revealed drops of moisture glistening
thickly on the walls around her, and she detected the dull sound of
water falling in perpetual rain from the low ceiling. This was the end
of her journey; this was her home. The man left her alone; no light, no
voice; the dull dropping of water from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span> roof was all the sound she
heard. No wonder that she cried out again, "My God, my God! why hast
Thou forsaken me?"</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="lxx" id="lxx"></a>CHAPTER LXX.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">THE PRISON ANGEL.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is no cavern so deep, no darkness so profound that the Holy One
cannot penetrate it with his mercy. It is unrepentant and stubborn guilt
alone which resists Him. Soon as the cry left her lips, Katharine found
her answer. Notwithstanding the hardness of her bed and the damp air
which floated heavily around her, she grew calm; some heavenly strength
fell upon her, and, folding her hands peacefully over her bosom, she
fell asleep. The water kept dropping from the roof, monotonous and cold;
the fresh straw grew moist under her cheek, but she smiled in the
darkness and whispered softly of a little child that had come from a
pleasant, happy place to comfort her, and which would visit that hard
couch nightly, and tell her of the heavenly home where it had found a
resting-place for them both.</p>

<p>When Katharine awoke in the morning, she was surprised to feel how
strong the night had made her, and she went forth to the life which had
seemed so terrible, with the firm resolve to find out her duty and do
it.</p>

<p>What human being ever turned resolutely to the performance of a duty
without finding some comfort growing up under it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
The gentleness and sweet obedience which marked Katharine Allen's
conduct in the prison, won many a kind word and act from her keepers.
Perhaps her beauty had something to do with this; but it was not her
beauty which made those rude men respect her in the cells of that copper
mine, as if she had been in the chambers of a palace. It was not her
beauty which checked the curses on the
<a name="convicts" id="convicts"></a><ins title="Original has convict's">convicts'</ins> lips, or
led them to some rude efforts of politeness as she passed in her humble
prison garb.</p>

<p>After awhile, Katharine began to see how wise and good the Almighty had
been in sending her to that gloomy place; how all unconsciously she had
been led to a great work through sorrows that prepared her for it, step
by step. If ever woman has a mission except that of performing the
duties which come naturally before her day by day, and hour by hour, it
is that of nursing the sick, and comforting the afflicted. Women were
intended for the gentler works of humanity, and who shall say that the
great reformers of the earth can surpass her in this mission of love, or
find a channel in all society through which her womanhood can be so
beautifully perfected?</p>

<p>It is guilt which makes the convict repulsive; attach a firm conviction
of innocence, or even repentance to the prisoner and his coarse dress
becomes picturesque, his hard fare sublime. When I describe Katharine
Allen in prison she is lifted out of all real convict life, but seems to
me like an angel wandering through those dark places, as one of old
sought out and unlocked the dungeon of the apostle. Suffering had done a
heavenly work with this young creature. Certainly, she had been unjustly
punished, but had not this chain of events<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span> brought her into a field of
great usefulness! Of her own accord would she ever have sought that
place, or descended that ladder? Yet where on earth was there a spot in
which humanity suffered so much, or where the influence of a good woman
could so surely bring comfort.</p>

<p>In her solitude, Katharine remembered many a wise lesson and kindly
precept that old Mr. Thrasher had taught her when she was restive in her
first imprisonment. It was wonderful how deeply the sayings of this good
old man had impressed her.</p>

<p>It was not long before Katharine was lifted out of the deepest misery of
her prison life and placed in the hospital as head nurse of that most
horrible place. The unwholesome position of the prison, the dreary
darkness of its mines, and the damps that trickled down their walls,
engendered diseases of all kinds with frightful rapidity, and that bleak
hospital room was always full. Those who know only of the common anguish
of comfortably appointed sick chambers can have little idea of the
terrible duties which fell upon this young creature. Instead of prayers
she heard little but raving curses of the past and eager cries for
release from that awful life, which was worse, these poor wretches
protested, over and over again, than any punishment which could await
their souls beyond the grave. Some would jest desperately about the ways
and means of this escape; laugh about the scant shrouds and pine boxes
in which they must set forth on the long journey. Others bore their pain
with stolid obstinacy, fearing to die, but dreading to get well, for
death gave them to the grave, health back into those damp mines, which
was a living burial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
With the sweet calm of one who finds an unexpected duty to be performed,
Katharine entered this place. Her very presence had a holy effect upon
the suffering convicts. Cruelty only hardens sin, and in those days
moral kindness to a convict was almost considered an offence against the
law. Men were convicted to be punished, not with any idea of
reformation, and being thrust utterly beyond the pale of mercy, grew
desperate and reviled one another when the evil spirit tortured within
them could find no other means of expression.</p>

<p>But the sweet goodness of this young woman, their fellow-prisoner,
softened all this. She comforted them with her gentle ways; soothed down
the profane spirit that gave out curses instead of groans, and dropped
softer feelings into those uneasy souls as Heaven gives dew to weeds
trampled along the dusty highway. She never preached, never exhorted
them, never forced the prison Bible upon their rejection; but the simple
promises of Scripture fell like poetry from her lips, at times when the
hungry soul of some poor convict, not utterly lost, seemed to crave
comfort at her hands. Sometimes, too, when a sick man, won by her
goodness, would ask where she found the beautiful words with which she
was striving to comfort him, Katharine would open the Bible and read
aloud to convince him of their reality. Then some patient in the next
cot would whisper her to read louder, and when her silvery voice was
lifted those sick men would turn wearily on the hard pillows and listen.</p>

<p>It is no great hardship to read or pray with the sick. Many a dainty
person can be found to perform such duties punctiliously; but to work
for the sick, to watch with them, wait on them, and with little means
supply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span> great wants&mdash;this is a noble work even for the patience and
endurance of a woman. This is charity in its perfect work, mingling
prayers, kindness, and stern labor in one beautiful phase of
Christianity. This work Katharine performed so well that the fiend which
she found brooding over the pillow of many a wretched fellow-creature,
stole away under the sound of her comfortings, and a pitying angel came
in his place. This was a work of slow growth, but alas! Katharine had
plenty of time&mdash;eight long years.</p>

<p>You ask me if this young girl was unhappy in her dreary life, and I
answer <i>no</i>. Those who confer great good on humanity by self-sacrifice,
cannot be made utterly miserable. To such hope never dies. No, I say
again, the slumber which
<a name="Katharine3" id="Katharine3"></a><ins title="Original has Catharine">Katharine</ins> found in her pauses of
rest was very sweet. At such times the dreary sound of those water-drops
trickling down the walls of her prison, seemed like the bell-like
murmurs of a fountain, around which a baby child&mdash;one that always came
in her dreams&mdash;was hovering and waiting for her to finish her work in
that prison and see how beautiful the world was beyond it.</p>

<p>I cannot pause now to give the details of her strange life, or tell you
how many touching events rose each day to interest her best feelings.
The prisoners, young and old, began to look upon her with affection.
Even the women, whose hearts are not always easy of access to a sister
woman, received her little kindnesses, when she found power to offer
them, with something like gratitude. All this won upon the officers of
the institution. With her they began to enforce the discipline of the
prison less rigidly than they had ever done before; employed her in
lighter tasks; gave their own needle-work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span> to her deft fingers; and
frequently supplied her with better food than was awarded to her fellow
sufferers. She received every favor with thankfulness, but took no
benefit to herself. The food which she appeared to carry off and consume
in private, went to the nourishing of some poor invalid, whose grateful
eyes thanked her and told of gentler feelings growing up in his heart.</p>

<p>Thus, through her favor with the prison officers and her influence with
the convicts, this young woman won for herself a power of good, which
those terrible walls had never witnessed since their foundation.</p>

<h2><a name="lxxi" id="lxxi"></a>CHAPTER LXXI.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">THE SWEATING OVEN.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Down</span> in the depths of those prison mines many a terrible scene took
place at which humanity shuddered. Once huddled under ground and sealed
in with the massive iron bars that crossed that small trap-door, little
care was needed for the safety of the prisoners. So, like wild cattle
hustled into a pound, they were left to their own vicious instincts, and
those often led to riot and revolt. Sometimes the terrible monotony of
this life was broken by a new gang of prisoners, who, shocked and
outraged in every manly feeling by the degradation heaped upon them,
fiercely resisted the rules which levelled them below the common brutes
of the field, and, like wild animals just lassoed on the prairies,
turned fiercely upon their tormentors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
Cases of horrible cruelty often occurred in the prison; Katharine knew
of it only from the fierce noises that echoed through her cell at night,
and by the frightened faces that passed before her during the next day.
It was enough to shock the most hardened human soul, to know that any of
those terrible means of punishment, invented as the curse of our
prisons, was in progress. The very idea was enough to drive the blood
from Katharine's heart. But she was helpless&mdash;had not even the power of
protest&mdash;all she could do was to turn her pitying eyes on the poor
wretch when his sufferings were over, and thus prove that compassion
existed even in that terrible place. Usually these scenes of punishment
ended in the hospital, then her sweet ministry made itself deeply felt,
and many a hard heart yielded itself to her kindness which the most
bitter correction had failed to reach.</p>

<p>Something of this kind had just transpired in the prison. A new convict
had been sent in from the courts, and his first resistance of the prison
laws had been met with unusual rigor. That night Katharine heard low
groans, but no cries followed the crack of the lash, which fell so
sharply and lasted so long that every nerve in her body quivered and
shrunk with that keen sympathy which made the anguish of a
fellow-creature her own.</p>

<p>She arose in the morning literally sore at heart, wounded with more
tender anxiety than had ever affected her before regarding the man who
had borne those awful lashes so bravely. Her duties for a time lay under
ground, where much of the prison work was done. She went about them with
a heavy heart. The damp, the close atmosphere, and absence of all
sunlight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span> deepened the despondency that had seized upon her. In these
subterraneous vaults is a vast oven, in which the prisoners' bread was
baked, and here her duties for the morning were appointed. A woman stood
before this oven casting wood into the red caverns of fire that glowed
behind the rolling smoke. The woman paused with a huge stick of pitch
pine half lifted to the oven, and balancing it a moment in her hands,
she cast it to the earth, and sitting down upon it began to cry.</p>

<p>Katharine advanced that moment, and touched her on the arm.</p>

<p>"I can't&mdash;I can't! Whip me, if you like&mdash;put me in with him, but I can't
do it!"</p>

<p>The woman evidently thought it one of the keepers, who had watched her
rebellious movement. Katharine bent over her.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Jones? It is only I. Can I help you?"</p>

<p>The woman looked up, relieved by the voice.</p>

<p>"No," she said, heavily. "It is the old story. You heard the lash last
night&mdash;it kept us all awake. It is a new prisoner they are breaking in;
a handsome, fine fellow; but he stood them out like a lion, and now&mdash;"</p>

<p>The woman paused and looked toward the oven with a sort of terror in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"And now&mdash;oh! Jane, is he dead?" whispered Katharine. "Did they kill
him?"</p>

<p>The woman pointed to a narrow door built close to the mouth of the oven,
and whispered&mdash;</p>

<p>"He is in there!"</p>

<p>Katharine recoiled.</p>

<p>"In there, and that fire raging so; God have mercy upon us! it is
death!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
"No, not always; not often, I think," answered the woman; "but I never
did this work before. The sweat oven has not been used in my time till
now. It's awful!"</p>

<p>A smothered moan, which rose above the roar and crackle of the fire,
curdled the very blood in Katharine's veins.</p>

<p>"What is it? What is the horrible thing they are doing?" she cried,
wildly. "What is that place?"</p>

<p>"You see the door&mdash;how narrow it is&mdash;a poor creature can hardly push
through. Inside, it is just as narrow; stone walls pressing close up
against the wretch, heated from the oven hot as life can bear."</p>

<p>"Oh, my God, my God, is this thing true?" cried Katharine, cowering
down, and covering her face with both hands.</p>

<p>"I wont heap on the wood," cried the woman, bitterly. "They haven't the
power to make me."</p>

<p>"Hush, hush; some one is coming."</p>

<p>It was a keeper to whom the terrible punishment had been entrusted.
Katharine rose slowly to her feet and stood before him, her hands
clasped, and the pale anguish of her face revealed by the fire light,
which illuminated the darkness all around them.</p>

<p>"What are you women talking about? Go to your work, Katharine Allen."</p>

<p>She could not speak, but fell upon her knees, beseeching him with those
wild eyes.</p>

<p>"What is all this about?" said the man, softening his voice.</p>

<p>"She wants you to let that poor man out&mdash;that's it," answered the woman,
resting both elbows on her knees, and looking up from her seat on the
wood. "She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span> knows it aint human to treat any of God's creatures in this
way, and wants to tell you so, only them groans has frightened the soul
out of her body."</p>

<p>The man looked down at the young creature kneeling at his feet, and a
shade of sympathy swept over his face.</p>

<p>"Get up," he said, almost kindly. "I have just come to see about him.
This sort of thing don't gibe with my feelings more than it does with
yours, but the fellow was obstinate as a mule&mdash;wanted a little of the
proud blood sweated out of him, and I reckon he's got enough of it by
this time."</p>

<p>"Oh, be quick, be quick, or he may die!" cried Katharine, gaining her
voice. "How faint the moans are! Open the door! open the door!&mdash;hear how
his poor hands beat against it!"</p>

<p>"Well, go away&mdash;this is no place for you. Run to the well, and have some
water dipped up ready. They always make a dive for that first."</p>

<p>Katharine sprang to her feet, and darting across the space illuminated
by the oven, made her way toward the well, which gushed out pure and
crystalline in the depths of the mine, the only untainted thing in those
subterranean regions. An iron lamp swung in the walls of the cavern near
this outgush of pure water, which turned all the wavelets it touched to
gold.</p>

<p>This was the spot to which the prisoners came when athirst, like cattle
to a spring; and to this place, as the keeper truly said, the man who
had suffered from the flames of that hot oven would surely come.</p>

<p>Katharine took an iron dipper, which was chained to the stones of the
well, and filling it with water, held it till the weight bore down her
hand, then she filled it once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span> more from the centre of the well, and
again held it ready. This time she had not long to wait, for she saw a
human figure coming through the darkness with desperate effort, but slow
progress&mdash;making futile attempts at speed, and giving broken leaps that
brought him reeling and staggering every instant against the sides of
the cavern.</p>

<p>Katharine poured out the water, and dipped it up afresh, as if that
little effort could make it cooler. She would have gone forward to meet
the man, but the chain would not permit it, and thus she stood waiting
till he came up. He saw the vessel in her hand, dripping over with a
rain of cool drops, and seizing upon it before she could look up,
drained it off in wild, greedy haste.</p>

<p>"More! more!" he cried, dropping the dipper, and sweeping the
perspiration from his face. "More! more!"</p>

<p>Katharine plunged the dipper into the well again. He would have snatched
it from her but she lifted it to his lips. In this position the
lamp-light fell upon her face. She dropped the iron vessel from between
her two hands, as he fell forward with his face to the earth. She did
not breathe&mdash;for her life she could not have uttered a sound&mdash;but
dropping on her knees beside the prostrate man, she lifted his head from
the earth. The light lay full upon his face. His eyes looked piteously
into hers. She drew him up to her bosom; with the folds of her prison
dress she wiped the rain of perspiration from his forehead and left
tender kisses in its place; soft words came to her lips, tears swelled
into her eyes; she had but one thought&mdash;holy thanksgiving to Heaven.</p>

<p>Directly the keeper came up, wondering that his victim should remain so
long at the well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
"Halloo!" he said, "what is this? I thought you were half dead, my fine
fellow!"</p>

<p>Katharine looked up; her face was radiant, and yet a tender pity beamed
there.</p>

<p>"Hush!" she said; "he is my husband."</p>

<p>The keeper gave a prolonged whistle that echoed mournfully through the
caverns, but Katharine repeated:</p>

<p>"Yes, it is my husband."</p>

<p>Thrasher did not speak, but she felt him trembling in her arms; his head
rested more heavily on her bosom; he scarcely breathed.</p>

<p>The keeper felt some gleams of sympathy swelling in his bosom. With him
Katharine had always been a favorite. He took compassion on her now.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow! he has had a tough job of it," he said; "weak as a
kitten&mdash;why, see how he trembles; I'll just go to the warden and have
him sent up to the hospital, where you can tend him till he picks up
again."</p>

<p>Katharine smiled gratefully, and they were left alone, the woman and her
husband. She bent down and kissed him.</p>

<p>"Nelson, my husband, speak one word&mdash;say that you know me."</p>

<p>He whispered hoarsely, "Yes, Katharine, I know you."</p>

<p>"And love me yet?"</p>

<p>The proud man was shorn of his strength, and burst into tears. When the
keeper returned, her hand was locked in that of her husband. He was
talking to her in a feeble voice, broken with grief; telling her things
which made even that dark place still darker&mdash;of his unfaithfulness and
its stern retribution. His heart was broken up, he kept nothing back.
His crimes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span> great, but the record was given in few words, saddening
the poor wife, who had been so happy a moment before, in spite of her
bonds. She heard him through, wondering that so much of joy should lie
underneath these facts, and whispering to herself: "He will be here
seven years, and I with him. Oh, how much can be done in seven years!"</p>

<p>The keeper had compassion on them; he led Thrasher away to that portion
of the prison devoted to the sick, and there the heaven of Katharine's
convict life grew bright, for she saw the path of her duty clear, and
knew, in her soul, that a holy work lay in her hands, a work of comfort
and regeneration, which should lead her husband into the sunlight again.</p>

<p>She forgave him from the depths of her own pure heart; she forgave him
all the wrong he had done, and all the hopes he had destroyed. Her care,
her gentleness, and the holy faith that pervaded her words and acts, had
its effect on this iron-hearted man. I cannot describe that which is
beyond words, or tell how this gentle martyr reached the stern man's
heart; but it softened day by day under her patient tending, and when he
went back to the dreary duties of those prison mines, it was with a
changed aspect. She had taught him, not only how beautiful a thing human
love is, but through that most sacred of earthly feelings, led him to
the holy source of all love, all honor, all the glory of life.</p>

<p>And so, as the years of their imprisonment wore on, these two people
bore their fate with something better than mere resignation. They were
content to work out the duties before them, feeling it recompense enough
if they could smile on each other in passing down to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span> places of
rest, or exchange a word of comfort and encouragement now and then by
the well, where they had first met.</p>

<p>Do not pity these people overmuch; where true love and faith exists,
there is little need of compassion. Out of the depths of his penitence
sprang up that perfect love which makes a heaven of any place. As for
Katharine, was not her prison life made bright and beautiful. What was
seven years of toil, hunger, and thirst to her if it redeemed the
husband who had been lost?</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="lxxii" id="lxxii"></a>CHAPTER LXXII.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">UNDER THE APPLE TREE.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Years</span> had passed&mdash;seven long years&mdash;and in that time many a pleasant
change had taken place around the minister's dwelling. Little twigs of
rose bushes had grown into blossoming thickets; the big apple tree in
the meadow had dry spray among its branches, like gray hairs on the head
of a strong man; tiny honeysuckle shoots had spread into luxuriant
vines; a row of red cherry trees along the fence was beginning to glow
with fruit in season. Every thing inside and out of the minister's
dwelling had prospered. He had scarcely grown a day older in his own
person. Indeed, with his home comforts so cared for, and his wardrobe in
order, he seemed a younger man than we found him, when, standing between
the two deacons, counselling about the meadow lot, which now bloomed
Eden-like around him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
As for the minister's wife, she had never looked so young, and it seemed
impossible that she should ever grow old; a few almost imperceptible
wrinkles marked the corners of her prim little mouth, but that was all.</p>

<p>Still, youth knows rapid changes, and other things than honeysuckles and
roses had bloomed into perfection at the parsonage. There was a lovely
girl sitting under the apple tree, not gathering fruit or blossoms, as
of old, but busy with her crochet needle and a ball of crimson worsted,
that would keep rolling from her lap into the grass in the most
provoking manner. By her side, half lying on the ground, was a youth,
the most splendid specimen of early manhood you ever saw, looking at her
as she worked, with an expression in those dark eyes which could only
have sprung from the one great passion of life.</p>

<p>As Rose worked, a smile dimpled the fresh mouth, and she glanced
sideways at Paul from under those long, brown lashes, coquetting with
him in her innocent way, but with a grace that was enough to bring the
youth's heart into his eyes. Jube was at work in the garden at a
distance, singing to himself, and pausing now and then to regard the
scene going on under the apple tree.</p>

<p>This was what was passing between the young people. Rose paused a moment
with her crochet hook in a half-looped stitch, and the smile trembled on
her sweet mouth. Paul had asked a question, expressed a thousand times
before, but never with that intonation and significance.</p>

<p>"Rose, do you love me?"</p>

<p>Now the bloom of roses mounted to her forehead, and swept down the snow
of her neck! Paul saw it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span> blushed also&mdash;the lashes drooped over
those great velvety eyes, and a strange thrill, too sweet for pain, too
new for entire pleasure, ran through his whole system.</p>

<p>"Rose, do you love me?"</p>

<p>As I have said, she had answered that question a thousand times before,
but now it took away her voice. She bent her head and commenced her work
again, looping up the worsted with desperate haste.</p>

<p>"Why don't you speak, Rose?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what to say," she replied, trembling all over.</p>

<p>"Don't know what to say!" repeated Paul, sitting upright, and turning
his startled eyes full upon her. "I ask if you love me, and&mdash;oh, Rose,
is there a doubt?"</p>

<p>Rose shook her head and bent over her work.</p>

<p>"If I ask this now," said Paul, very earnestly, "it is because I wish to
be certain that&mdash;that&mdash;oh, Rose, why can't you answer me?"</p>

<p>"I have answered, Paul."</p>

<p>"But you turn away. You will not look at me."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;see, I do."</p>

<p>His face brightened all over; taking her hand, which he tangled up in
the crimson thread in his impetuosity, he pressed it to his lips.</p>

<p>"I am going away, Rose."</p>

<p>"Going away&mdash;oh, Paul!"</p>

<p>"Yes; don't turn so white. I shall come back again in a few months&mdash;it
is not so far off."</p>

<p>"Where, where?"</p>

<p>She could not complete the sentence, her tears rose so quick and fast.</p>

<p>"I am going back to my old home, Rose, in St. Domingo. My father was a
rich man there&mdash;one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span> first and highest in the island. I can
remember that without help, but Jube has told me more than this. He and
his brothers, a large family, were all killed in that awful massacre.
They had great riches in gold and jewels. I saw piles and piles of gold
brought into my father's house that last week, and heard those
gentlemen, my father and his brothers, pledge themselves to defend it
each for the other, so long as one of them should live. This compact was
not written, but engraved on a brick of gold, that it might be
permanent, and carry its own record wherever the treasures went. I was a
boy, and too young for a trust of so much magnitude. Where these
treasures were put I never knew. My uncles were all killed. My father,
my mother&mdash;oh, Rose, you know about that. I alone was left of the
family. Jube, dear old Jube yonder, is all the servant of our great
household. My mother entrusted him with her jewels. They fell into the
hands of Captain Thrasher."</p>

<p>Rose uttered a faint cry, and covered her face to hide its shame.</p>

<p>"Don't, Rose, don't," said Paul; "I am not blaming any one. Only telling
you how it happened that Jube and I became so poor. There was some gold
with the jewels, and that Rice made Thrasher give up. It has supported
us ever since, for Rice traded with it, and kept it growing, good
fellow. But that is very little, Rose. It kept us from being a burden
here, but what would it amount to when&mdash;when&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When what, Paul?"</p>

<p>"When you and I are married, Rose."</p>

<p>The young girl drew a quick breath. The crochet hook fell from her
hand&mdash;her arms, neck and face were bathed in blushes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
"Have you never thought of this, Rose?" said Paul, tenderly.</p>

<p>"I don't&mdash;don't know, Paul."</p>

<p>"But you will think of it?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"All the while I am gone?"</p>

<p>"Gone!" The tears that had been trembling in her eyes dropped to the
roses on her cheek. He saw her grief and exulted in it.</p>

<p>"Jube knows where those treasures were buried. It was a safe place, deep
in the vaults under my father's house. The negroes would never search
there. Jube will go with me; we shall find all this gold, and then,
Rose, then&mdash;"</p>

<p>She looked up, piteously.</p>

<p>"I don't care for gold; I hate jewels; from that day I have hated them.
Don't go, Paul; I shall die before you come back."</p>

<p>"But we must live. When your father comes from the Indies, I cannot ask
for his daughter without some way of earning or giving her bread. Those
treasures belong to me. I am the last heir of our house. It is for your
sake I shall search for them."</p>

<p>"No, no; I am afraid. There may be another shipwreck," cried the young
girl, wringing her hands.</p>

<p>"Hush, hush, Rose! Jube is looking this way; the old fellow will wonder
what we are talking about."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but you wont go, Paul? It is too cruel."</p>

<p>"Not till you consent. You are my queen now, Rose, and shall keep or
send me as you like."</p>

<p>She brightened with a sudden thought.</p>

<p>"Wait till father comes," she said, dashing her tears right and left
with those white hands, "and then we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span> can all go together&mdash;that is, if
father has not money enough of his own."</p>

<p>Paul pressed her hand again gratefully, as if she had indeed reigned his
queen, and once more they sunk into the old attitude, save that she did
not pretend to work, and Paul no longer vailed the joy in his eyes.</p>

<p>They did not hear the rattle of wheels, or know that a wagon had stopped
at the parsonage; thus when Jube came hurriedly from his work in the
garden, with intelligence in his face, Rose received him with a pretty
pout, and Paul inquired rather sharply what he wanted coming upon them
in that rude way.</p>

<p>Poor Jube was quite taken aback. Never in his whole life had he been so
received by the young people; the joyful words were driven from his
lips, and he stood mutely gazing at them like a Newfoundland dog rebuked
for too much spirit.</p>

<p>"What did you want?" inquired Paul, self-rebuked and softened.</p>

<p>"Why, nothing, master, only Tom has just got out of the wagon and is
coming this way."</p>

<p>"Tom! What&mdash;Tom Hutchins?"</p>

<p>"Yes, master; that's him coming through the kitchen door."</p>

<p>Rose started up all in commotion. The idea of meeting her rustic boy
lover just then filled her with dismay. But there was no escape. He was
half across the meadow, making directly for the apple tree. A fine,
powerful young fellow he certainly was&mdash;broad-chested and stout of
limb&mdash;but there was the same frank face, the same freckles on the
cheeks, the same laughing blue eyes. He came up a little awkwardly, not
exactly knowing how to use his arms in walking, and halted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span> a few yards
from Rose in blank astonishment at her beauty. She went toward him at
once holding out her hands.</p>

<br />
<span class="sub">OUT OF A SCRAPE.</span></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Hutchins</span>, I am so glad to see you!"</p>

<p>He took her outstretched hands and pressed them together between his two
hard palms.</p>

<p>"Jest as sweet as ever; and oh, lots handsomer!" he said, with awkward
gallantry.</p>

<p>"This is Paul," said Rose, embarrassed by his rough compliment. "He has
not forgotten you."</p>

<p>"Nor I him, by a long shot," answered Tom, with energy. "How are you,
old fellow? Know how to speak English, hey?"</p>

<p>Paul laughed, and lost his slender hand in Tom's grasp.</p>

<p>"I've got a little business with you, by-and-by," said Tom; "something
terrible mysterious; and nothing would do but I must come right across
from Simsbury and bring it myself. You guess, I reckon, what took me out
there?"</p>

<p>"To see her?" inquired Paul, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, nothing else. The old people are getting infirm, and can't travel
no more. That trial kinder did them up for going journeys, yet they aint
content without hearing all about her every few months. So this time I
went up. Had a little chore of my own in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span> 'ere region, and wasn't
backward to go; besides, I raly du feel sorry for them old folks. Not
one word have they heard from Nelse Thrasher yet&mdash;think he's lost at
sea, and that has nigh about broke their hearts. They are getting old
now, I tell you."</p>

<p>"And you have been to see Katharine&mdash;that was very kind, Tom. If ever a
good woman lived, she is one. How did you find her?"</p>

<p>"Handsomer than ever. I swan to man! she looked like an angel just come
down, for all that linsey-woolsey dress. She's soft and still as a dove
in brooding-time&mdash;never complains&mdash;never sheds no tears, but goes about
like&mdash;like&mdash;oh, it aint of the least use trying to give you any idea of
it."</p>

<p>"But her time is nearly up; she'll be coming out soon."</p>

<p>"Not jest to the day, I reckon. She told me not to let them send arter
her, for she'd got a duty beyond her freedom day, and must wait till
some one else was set free; then she would start for home, and stay with
the old people all her life."</p>

<p>"It is like her, poor soul," said Paul, with deep feeling; "but who is
the person for whose liberation she is waiting?"</p>

<p>"Jest step this way a minute, and I'll tell you."</p>

<p>Paul stepped aside, and walked reluctantly away from Rose.</p>

<p>"Look-a-here&mdash;she didn't tell me nothing, only in her sweet way asked me
not to give the old folks any news that would trouble them, as if she
kinder thought I knew; but if I didn't see Nelse Thrasher in that 'ere
prison, that fellow has got a twin brother that's been tried and
convicted."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
Paul started. Had Thrasher indeed been punished? Was he now atoning his
crime in prison? A moment's thought, and he understood it all. The
generous privacy with which the trial had been kept, that disgrace need
not reach Rose or her mother. He remembered now that soon after Mason's
visit, the minister and his wife had been absent at the county town
several days, and no one could tell why. How well the secret had been
kept!</p>

<p>"We must not mention this before Rose," he said, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Nor the old people neither," replied Tom. "In this case the least said
is soonest mended; but it was him, no mistake about that. To own up, he
gin me this letter with his own hands, and a little heap of shiney
stones that he dug out from the wall of his cell, where they'd been hid
ever since he went to the prison. Katharine told him he could trust me,
and he did; but you never seen a feller so altered&mdash;he's grown steady
and sober-looking, and has a soft, kind way of speaking that makes your
heart rise up to meet him. I never did see any thing like it. He's
learned to smile, and it does you good to see it. I raly believe he'll
live to be a comfort to them old people at last&mdash;that is when his time
is up."</p>

<p>"I hope so," answered Paul, thoughtfully; "but you had a letter&mdash;is it
for Rose?"</p>

<p>"No; for you."</p>

<p>"For me."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;do you know that the chap raly thought that you was dead and
drowned in the salt sea, till a little while ago, when Katharine
happened to tell him about your coming up to Bungy with Jube, and how
you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span> tried to help her, poor young critter. You remember that night?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I shall never forget it."</p>

<p>"Well, it seems he was thankful to know that you hadn't gone down with
the wreck&mdash;you and the nigger; and he's been a trying to get this 'ere
letter to you by safe hands ever since, but couldn't light on a
downright honest chap till now."</p>

<p>Paul reached forth his hand to receive the letter, thinking, in his kind
heart, "Poor man! he was cruel to me, and repents of it. I am glad for
his own sake."</p>

<p>With these thoughts he broke the seal and began to read:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Paul De Varney, I have wronged you, and would make restitution
so far as human will can atone for crime. You are, <i>I</i> know, the
only living heir of that proud old house which the Revolution
destroyed. The treasures which were concealed by the males of
your family, in a solemn compact, and buried in the vaults of
your father's house, are in this country. I brought them in the
vessel which Captain Mason had commanded from Port au Prince,
removed them safely from the Floyd when she was abandoned, and
the great bulk of them has never passed from my hands. In the
vicinity of New York is a large mansion house, purchased some
years ago by a Mr. Nelson. If you ask for this man Nelson, they
will tell you that he is of unsound mind, and has been safely
housed for years in an insane asylum. But this is the truth&mdash;I,
Nelson Thrasher, am the man to whom that house belonged. In the
depths of a secret vault, which you will find under the south
wing, I have concealed the treasures which are yours. There is a
room in that wing, furnished as a gentleman's study, the floor
is a mosaic of colored marble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
"I send you a drawing of the design. The centre ornament, marked
A, will yield if you touch the fourth curve of the arabasque
pattern. You descend into a wine vault; the rack of bottles
swings on hinges. Behind it; five feet from the corner, each
way, is a slab of granite cemented into the wall; remove that,
and lying in the entrance of a small inner vault you will find a
Gold Brick, upon which the males of your house have engraved
their compact, their names, and those of their descendants. All
are dead except yourself. The treasure is yours. How I became
possessed of it, the amount expended, and a solemn renunciation,
you will find rudely cut on the lower side of the brick. Take
possession of this wealth; no one will dare to question your
right. All that I have in possession, and all that I can
restore, is herewith forwarded. If you can only feel the joy in
receiving this wealth that I do in casting it from me, the day
that you read this will be a happy one, the first that ever
resulted from this hoarded gold.</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Nelson Thrasher.</span>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Paul read the letter over and over again. The contents seemed unreal;
but for the clear description of the Gold Brick he would not have given
it credence. But he remembered that well. The night when the seething
metal had been poured into its mould, every member of the family had
been summoned to stand by. The scene rose vividly before him. The red
heat of the furnace glaring on the vault, the piles of gold throwing
back its light, that group of aristocratic men stooping one after
another to engrave a name on the dead gold of the brick, till he, the
youngest and the last was called upon to take the graver in his young
hand, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span> under his father's direction, record his name on the golden
record.</p>

<p>Paul had not understood the danger which prompted his kinsmen to gather
up their treasures and make this singular record on the brick, but the
storm came upon them at once.</p>

<p>In a single week that whole household had been swept away&mdash;father,
mother, home. Is it wonderful that the young man grew pale, and
shuddered, when Thrasher's letter reminded him of these things?</p>

<p>Paul had no heart to return to Rose. For the moment he thought of
nothing but that terrible scene which had left him an orphan. He walked
slowly away, and entering the house, sought the minister's study.</p>

<p>Tom Hutchins went back to the spot where Rose was standing.</p>

<p>"Miss Rose," he said, shuffling his feet in the grass, "you remember
when I gave you a string of robins' eggs, and what I said about 'em?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Rose, blushing quietly, for the poor string of eggs had
been smashed to atoms in a romping chase with Jube years ago.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Hutchins&mdash;I&mdash;I hope you don't want them back again."</p>

<p>Tom looked rather crestfallen, colored violently, and relieved his right
foot by standing heavily on the left.</p>

<p>"No, Miss Rose," he burst out at length, "I aint going to ask for 'em
back, but&mdash;but the truth is, I was a scamp for giving you them 'ere
eggs; not at the time, you know, but arterwards, when I kinder forgot
you and took a shine to another gal. There, now, it's out, and I suppose
you'll just hate and despise me for a mean heart-breaker all the rest of
your life. But I could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span> help it, consarn me if I could. If the gal
hadn't looked kinder like you, in the way of curls, and been a match for
the best on 'em, I never should have gin in; but it's done, and can't be
undone, without you insist on holding me to that bargain when I give the
eggs. If you do, why speak out, and I'm ready to stand up to the rack,
fodder or no fodder."</p>

<p>Rose did not laugh, but her eyes were brimful of fun, and her lips
dimpled threateningly.</p>

<p>"Don't&mdash;don't cry; it 'ud break my heart. I aint downright engaged, nor
nothing, and I waited to see if you'd give me up afore that&mdash;but&mdash;but if
you'd just as lives, 'thar is as good fish in the sea as ever come out,'
you know; still, as I said, if you didn't seem to mind it, I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rose shook with the rush of laughter that was forbidden to her lips, but
she felt a sort of respect for the honest purpose which had brought the
youth to her presence, and answered him with gentle kindness:</p>

<p>"Have no trouble about me, Mr. Hutchins&mdash;we were only children then."</p>

<p>"True enough&mdash;so we were."</p>

<p>"You were very kind to us, and I can never forget it."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't&mdash;don't, Miss Rose&mdash;you make me feel what a scoundrel I was
ever to think of anybody else."</p>

<p>"Ah, but it was impossible to help it."</p>

<p>"Do you think so now&mdash;really?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I do."</p>

<p>"And you wont hate me?"</p>

<p>"Not at all."</p>

<p>"Nor think me fickle?"</p>

<p>"Oh, children are always fickle; but we meet as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span> grown people, now, and
there will be no more change. You are content, and so am I."</p>

<p>"In downright arnest?"</p>

<p>"In downright earnest."</p>

<p>"Miss Rose."</p>

<p>"Well."</p>

<p>"If I was not over head and heels in love&mdash;well, it's no use talking;
but there aint your match this side creation, except her."</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="lxxiv" id="lxxiv"></a>CHAPTER LXXIV.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">THE LONELY HOUSE.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">That</span> noble mansion had changed greatly. The beauty of its grounds was
all run to waste. The snowy walls of the house were tinged with the damp
of many winters, which no careful hand had swept away. Rose thickets had
grown into jungles. The honeysuckles and clematis vines had leaped from
the windows and clambered rudely up the forest trees. Long grass waved
along the carriage walks and tufted the gravel. That delicate moss,
which seems like the first green breath of decay, was creeping over the
broad marble steps, and clothing the stone vases with gloomy richness.</p>

<p>It was very lonely and quiet, that dreary mansion, a mournful contrast
to its appearance on the night we saw it last, in pristine freshness,
blazing with lights, resonant with music, and all aglow with flowers.</p>

<p>Four persons, who stood in the wilderness which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span> grown around it,
felt this desolation with infinite melancholy.</p>

<p>"Was this my mother's house?" whispered Rose Mason, sadly. "Oh! Paul,
where is she now? Not one word from her in all these years."</p>

<p>"Hush, my child," said the minister; "it may have been that trouble has
fallen upon her so heavily that, like a poor worried deer, she has crept
away to hide her wounds."</p>

<p>"My poor, poor mother," whispered Rose; "but for that man, how happy we
might all be now."</p>

<p>"Be patient, my child, be patient."</p>

<p>"How can I be patient, knowing that she lives&mdash;at least, feeling the
mournful hope&mdash;and yet with no certainty? How can I be patient, when my
father is away where I cannot see him, wandering from country to
country, trying to forget his wrongs&mdash;trying, in vain, to forget her?"</p>

<p>The minister looked troubled. This rebellion in his spoiled pet, wounded
him like a reproach. He felt how deep were her causes for regret, and
left the anguish to exhaust itself.</p>

<p>"There must be some one at the house who will know where she is living.
The mansion is evidently inhabited. Let us go forward and inquire. We
are legally authorized to enter," said Paul.</p>

<p>"Yes," rejoined the minister, looking at a strange man who was walking
down the carriage street with Jube, "here comes our authority; but let
us use it with delicacy; soft words are better than warrants; by them
our Rose may gain some knowledge of her mother."</p>

<p>The group moved forward; that is, Paul, the minister, and Rose, leaving
the stranger and Jube in the grounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
The broad steps had a disused look, as if foot-prints were seldom left
upon them; the huge knocker was dim, and grated harshly as the minister
lifted it. When it fell, the noise struck them with a shock, its
reverberations sounded so startling. It was a long time before any one
came to the door; but at last it opened, and an ill-dressed, unshaven
man looked out with unwelcoming eyes.</p>

<p>"Do you want any thing?" he said, curtly; "nobody comes to this door. We
never see company."</p>

<p>"But we wish to enter the house, and have business which cannot be put
off," said Paul.</p>

<p>"Who is it you want to see?"</p>

<p>"Any one who has authority to admit us to an examination of one of the
rooms."</p>

<p>"There is no such person here."</p>

<p>The answer was brusque enough, like that which the keeper of a prison
gives to troublesome visitors.</p>

<p>"Let us see your master, if you please," said the minister, blandly.</p>

<p>"I have no master!"</p>

<p>"Nor mistress?"</p>

<p>"No, nor mistress. I am <i>her</i> master!"</p>

<p>Rose started, and looked mournfully at Paul.</p>

<p>"What is the lady's name?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"She has fifty names. To-day I believe she is the Empress of Russia."</p>

<p>"But she has a name?"</p>

<p>"Not for strangers. If you have any business here but to ask questions
let me hear what it is; no one else will get a say in the matter, I can
tell you."</p>

<p>Paul beckoned to the man who lingered in the shrubbery. He came up and
held a few words of conversation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span> with the servant, who seemed greatly
disturbed, and at once attempted to close the door forcibly. The officer
opposed him, and, placing a paper in his hands, bade him make way.</p>

<p>He read the paper with a bewildered look, which changed to something
like consternation in the end. He flung the door wide open, and,
retreating down the entrance-hall, unlocked a door which led to the
south wing.</p>

<p>"You will find the office in yonder," he said, pointing through the
door. "I don't know what condition it is in, for no one has entered it,
that I know of, for years."</p>

<p>The party passed in, all except Rose, who remained to question the man.
But her distress was so great that it took away her voice.</p>

<p>"Well, what is it you want?" he asked, with a tone of kindness, for the
agitation in her lovely face impressed even him.</p>

<p>"Tell me her name. The lady of the house, I mean."</p>

<p>"And what good if I do? She's nobody now&mdash;that is to any one but us.
What on earth is her name to you?"</p>

<p>"I think&mdash;I fear&mdash;ah, sir, she may be my own mother."</p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Mason."</p>

<p>"That is not her name, anyhow; but the other name&mdash;is it Rose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes&mdash;Rose!"</p>

<p>"Not Rose Nelson?"</p>

<p>"No, no!"</p>

<p>"It's of no use then: she's nothing to you."</p>

<p>"Oh, if you would but let me speak with her! only look on her face!"
pleaded the poor girl, wild with the hopes his questions had raised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
"I could not do it. It is against the doctor's orders. Company is worse
than any thing."</p>

<p>"Is she ill?"</p>

<p>He now looked on her with contemptuous astonishment.</p>

<p>"You call yourself her daughter, and don't know that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, this is cruel! I have not had a letter or heard from her in
nearly seven years! I never knew that this had been her home till within
a week; and now you will not let me even look at her!"</p>

<p>The poor girl began to sob and wring her hands. The idea that she was so
close by her mother, whom she was forbidden to look upon, overwhelmed
her with anguish.</p>

<p>The man seemed touched. "Wait a moment," he said, "I will talk with Mrs.
Brown about it. I command the house, but she has charge of the lady."</p>

<p>After this concession, the man went away, leaving Rose seated upon one
of the hall chairs, breathless and anxious, for every moment convinced
her more and more that she was in the house with her mother.</p>

<p>The man was absent some time. Suspense became intolerable to that young
heart. She arose and walked the hall, but the noise of her own footsteps
became irksome, as it prevented her listening to the first sound of his
approach. She stood still and held her breath. Would he never return?
What if he had seemed to relent only to escape her importunity? She
started. Yes, yes&mdash;there was a sound&mdash;a footstep&mdash;lighter than his,
though&mdash;a woman's footstep, accompanied with the rustle of silk and a
perfume that penetrated pleasantly to her senses, a perfume that she
recognized, and grew faint from the consciousness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
Trembling in all her limbs, she stood still, with her eyes penetrating
the distance. There was a perpetual twilight in that house. The blinds
were all closed, and in some places heavy shutters made the darkness
complete. Thus the figure which advanced upon Rose, from what seemed a
large drawing-room, moved vaguely through the dusk of the dwelling. It
was a lady in full dress, sweeping through the rooms in quick haste, and
huddling something to her bosom.</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="lxxv" id="lxxv"></a>CHAPTER LXXV.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">THE MANIAC'S TOILET.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Rose Mason</span> caught her breath. It was her mother. She knew the face, and
that proud, sweeping walk. Wild as the face was&mdash;rapid as the walk had
become&mdash;she could not mistake them.</p>

<p>The woman saw her standing in the hall, and came eagerly forward.</p>

<p>"I have found them&mdash;I have found them," she cried, breathlessly. "What
is an empress without her jewels? They don't understand these
things&mdash;but you, my maid of honor, know better. They told me that you
and all the court would keep away. That was to persuade me from wearing
these; but I have got them safe&mdash;come, come, we must make haste, or
force the people to wait, which should never be. My hair is to be
braided yet&mdash;come this way&mdash;this way."</p>

<p>Rose followed her, pale as death, heart-stricken from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span> that moment. The
woman entered the little breakfast room, where we have seen her before.
It was not much changed; the sumptuous appointments had faded somewhat
by time, but they retained all their elegance. In spite of her
agitation, Rose remarked that behind the rich window draperies were
immovable blinds of iron, deceptive, but firm as prison bars. Through
the lattices of these blinds, sufficient light came to fill the room,
and now Rose saw her mother clearly. Alas! the change! That beautiful
face was worn and troubled; the splendid eyes were full of eager fire;
the mouth was always in motion; and the whole aspect vigilant, as if her
fears were eternally upon the watch.</p>

<p>"Come," she said, throwing herself into an easy chair, and arranging the
folds of a purple brocade dress, with an exaggeration of her old,
queenly grace, after she had placed the heavy bronze box, which she had
carried, on an ottoman by her side, "come, put them on quick, before
they break up my toilet&mdash;go to work&mdash;go to work."</p>

<p>With eager wildness, she snatched the comb from her hair and shook its
long tresses over her shoulders. Rose saw that there was scarcely a dark
thread in the mass, and her eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>"What are you crying for?" asked her mother, sharply. "It is only
powdered pearls that my people dust over my hair morning and night!
Cleopatra, she was queen of Egypt, you know, and beautiful as I am&mdash;she
drank her pearls in vinegar; I grind mine! Now braid away! braid away!"</p>

<p>Rose took the heavy tresses which the woman tossed into her hands, and,
for a moment, her trembling fingers wandered among them, in vague
efforts at obedience, but all at once her strength gave way, and
dropping into a chair, she burst into a passion of tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
Her mother started up fiercely, coiled the hair around her head in a
rude crown, and dashed the lid of the bronze box open. Rose knew the
gleam of those jewels, and shuddered. The woman tore the diamonds from
their satin cushions, and began to huddle them in masses upon her arms
and bosom. She then proceeded to tangle them in her gray hair, looking
at her daughter with fierce reproach all the time.</p>

<p>Rose made a motion to arise&mdash;her mother saw it, and shut the box
suddenly.</p>

<p>"Don't touch them! don't dare to touch them! Do you know how much they
cost?"</p>

<p>The young girl retreated, pale and trembling.</p>

<p>"I bought them," cried the mother, in a hoarse whisper, "with my soul
and body&mdash;soul and body! Understand that! But the fiend cheated me, and
kept back the price!&mdash;treasures! gold! gold! gold! He hid it! but I kept
these! They were the first price! It was putting them here where my
little Rose used to sleep! and here where they burn like hot coals&mdash;that
brought Mason back with those eyes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The woman laid a hand upon her bosom, and swept it across her forehead
as she spoke, while poor Rose began to weep bitterly, as she heard her
own sweet name uttered, for the first time in years, by those insane
lips.</p>

<p>"No wonder you cry," said the woman. "It's enough to break one's heart!
Loads and loads of money hid away, and no finding it! I've searched, and
searched, and searched; but it's of no use! They lock the door and chain
the windows; but there is a place!"</p>

<p>She paused, drew close to Rose, and bending down, whispered in her ear:</p>

<p>"The south wing; he was always there; always brooding over something in
that room with one door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span> and iron shutters. Once I saw a hole in the
floor&mdash;an open half-moon&mdash;just under my feet. It closed up, and I forgot
it till Mason came, and they began to lock the doors; then I thought and
thought, such fiery hot thoughts, and up came that open half-moon from
the marble floor! Oh, if I could but get there! Say, couldn't you draw
the bolts? They hurt my hands! they hurt my hands!"</p>

<p>The poor creature shook her head, and wrung her hands, with tears and
moans, piteous to hear.</p>

<p>Rose took the poor struggling hands in hers.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother! mother!" she cried out.</p>

<p>The woman stopped wringing her hands, and bent her wild eyes on the
young girl's face.</p>

<p>"Rose had sweet eyes&mdash;my little Rose. She was so pretty&mdash;handsome almost
as her mother. But what is the use of beauty if it cannot bring gold
from its hiding-places? I like that face; there are emeralds and
sapphires in the box. Besides, I have lovely pink coral that the queen
of Naples gave me on my coronation. You shall wear them sometimes, for I
love you for looking like little Rose. There, you may kiss my hand."</p>

<p>Rose took the hand, on which she pressed her quivering lips.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid of me&mdash;imperial women are always gracious. You shall
stay at the court. Only one thing I must tell you. That woman, Brown,
shall be exiled to Siberia&mdash;that is where I get the ermine for my
mantles, you know; but cold, oh, so cold! Good enough for her, though.
Come close and I will tell you something. She ties my arms&mdash;she straps
me down in bed&mdash;the false traitoress! But she shall go, and I will give
you her place. Only don't speak loud, she might hear us.
Hush&mdash;hush&mdash;hist!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
A slight noise broke the stillness of the house, and hushed the maniac's
whispers. Putting a finger to her lips she moved into the hall on
tiptoe. The door leading to the south wing was open. With a cry that
brought an echo of affright from her child, she darted through and
rushed toward the room where Thrasher had been confined that night&mdash;her
garments fluttering wildly, and the jewels with their innumerable
pendants tinkling against each other in her hair and on her bosom.</p>

<p>Rose followed, striving to cry out, but terror deprived her of the
power.</p>

<p>The room was dark, for the bolts of those shutters had rusted in their
sockets&mdash;dark, except a circle of red light that lay like a fiery wheel
in the centre of the room. Ellen Mason rushed toward this opening, and
swooping down upon her knees, like an evil-omened bird greedy for prey,
looked down into the vault beneath. She saw the glitter of gold heaped
on the stone floor, with a blaze of lamp light pouring over it. Heard
the clink as it was drawn from the inner vault. She saw several persons
busy with the gold piling it in heaps. The most prominent figure was a
young man with jet black hair and eyes full of trouble, examining a
block of gold which lay on the top of that glittering heap.</p>

<p>With a shriek from which the words, "It is mine&mdash;mine&mdash;all mine!" broke
fiercely out, the woman half rose, flung out her arms, and made a
plunge. Rose Mason came up that instant and grasped desperately at her
dress. A fragment of the old brocade was left in her hand&mdash;a low, dull
sound, a simultaneous shriek of dismay from the people in the vault, and
all was still as death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
Rose had fallen with her face to the floor, white as the marble on which
she lay, and almost as lifeless.</p>

<p>Paul, disturbed by the noise overhead, had retreated from the treasures,
dropped the brick, and was looking up when that unhappy woman plunged
downward upon the gold. Her hands were extended, and made one grasp into
the heap. The old coins rattled down to the pavement&mdash;her temple struck
a corner of the Gold Brick, and a cluster of diamonds which she had
fastened there was driven through deep into the brain. She struggled a
little, gasped once or twice, stretched her limbs out upon the treasure,
and died there.</p>

<h2><a name="lxxvi" id="lxxvi"></a>CHAPTER LXXVI.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">THE DOCTOR'S RIDE.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">If</span> the doctor was an eccentric man, he could be, when the occasion
demanded it, both kind and thoughtful. More than once during Katharine's
confinement he had ridden far beyond his circuit, and visited her in
that lonely prison. No one was ever made aware of the fact, and he
alone, of all that neighborhood, with one exception, was informed that
Nelson Thrasher was also an inmate of the same prison. From the good old
people it had been kept with religious delicacy. They knew that
Katharine had a right to her freedom, and could now return home at
pleasure; but she had written to ask more time. Duties, she said, to her
fellow-prisoners kept her among them yet a little longer. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span> was free
to depart, but the hospital needed her, and with the warden's consent
she remained in voluntary service, teaching those whom she would soon
leave behind how to tend and comfort the sick as she had done. This was
an appeal that the old people could understand, so the lone mother
submitted quietly to a few more months of solitude, and the Thrashers
said to each other:</p>

<p>"Who knows but Nelson may come back before then?"</p>

<p>But time creeps on, even in a prison, and at last Thrasher was set free.
The doctor knew the time, and had the harness put on his old friend that
morning at an early hour. The horse did not exactly like this
proceeding. He objected to any long ride without the saddle-bags.
Indeed, he did not feel exactly like a respectable doctor's horse
without that appendage, and remonstrated against the indignity of reins,
thills, and whiffle-trees, with vigorous shakes of the head, and even a
vicious kick or two. But the doctor came out and expostulated with him
after his own quaint fashion, and directly the two went off in harmony,
one at each end of the reins.</p>

<p>For two whole days the sick of that neighborhood for fifteen miles
around took care of themselves, and grumbled accordingly.</p>

<p>On the evening of the second day, there was a terrible rumbling of loose
wheels along the Derby turnpike, for the brown horse had caught sight of
his home, and instantly went off in a rickety series of leaps that
almost tossed the doctor from his seat in front of the wagon.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid," he said, turning to the back seat, where a man and
woman were seated, with the light of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span> a crescent moon lying tenderly on
their faces. "It's his way when things go to suit him. The sight of home
always sets him off."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am not afraid," said a sweet female voice "It's a long time since
either of us have known what fear was. Isn't it, Nelson?"</p>

<p>The man thus addressed clasped the little hand which stole into his with
tender force, but said nothing. His heart was too full. The trial that
lay before him at the end of that ride might have taxed the courage of
any man.</p>

<p>They rode on to the doctor's house. He got out of the wagon, removed the
temporary seat which had accommodated him from Simsbury, and held a
silent counsel with his horse, patting the old fellow on the neck, and
using all the conciliatory blandishments for deluding horseflesh into
obedience, which have since been dignified into a science.</p>

<p>"There now, get along," he said, moving toward the gate. "He'll go ahead
without balking. No need of a whip. The old chap wont stand that from
anybody but me. Drive on, and God be with you."</p>

<p>The strange man leaned heavily on his crutches, and gently lifted his
hat as he uttered these words. The soft moonlight fell upon his head,
and a grander one seldom bared itself in reverence to a noble sentiment.</p>

<p>As the doctor wheeled around he saw the members of his family coming out
to welcome him home. His manner changed at once. Inwardly delighted with
their prompt affection he put the children aside with good-natured
rebukes of their clamorous joy, and stalking into the room, which served
as an office, sunk quietly into a leathern easy chair, and desired the
eldest boy to hand down his fiddle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
The boy took an old violin from its place on the wall and gave it into
his father's hand. The doctor drew a lump of rosin from his pocket,
rasped the bow with it for a full minute, then lifting the instrument to
his shoulder began to play; directly the children came rushing in from
the hall and kitchen, astonished, for some of the wildest and most
invigorating music heard for many a day, rang out from the dark old
violin, filling the whole house with cheerfulness.</p>

<p>The doctor's wife&mdash;a fine woman, of the Connecticut stamp&mdash;came softly
into the room with word that his supper was on the table; but he only
answered with a dash at Yankee Doodle, and revelled in it with a zest
ten thousand suppers could not have excited. The good housewife never
urged her husband to any thing; she knew the folly of that too well; so
she sat down pleasantly and listened to his music. It was well worth the
trouble, for the doctor threw off a world of generous thankfulness in
those erratic notes, and when music comes from the soul it is always
good. She asked no questions, but knew very well that something
satisfactory had happened to her husband, for he always expressed these
feelings through his violin.</p>

<p>Meantime the two travellers kept on up the turnpike. They passed the
rock spring, which sparkled out from the shadows cast over it from the
dogwood thickets; all cut up root and branch in these days, and moved
slowly over the old bridge. They could see the white spire of the
Episcopal church, rising into the moonlight from the high bank opposite,
and, with the sight, Katharine's heart melted within her. She lifted her
eyes to Thrasher; the moonlight lay full upon his face. It was pale and
troubled. In that church he had been baptized.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
Katharine took his hand with touching gentleness, and pressed it to her
lips. Her face was so heavenly that he bent down and kissed it, leaving
a heavy tear on her cheek, which she would not have wiped away for the
world.</p>

<p>"Ah, Nelson!" she said, clasping her hands and lifting her eyes from the
church spire to the heavens, which it seemed to penetrate&mdash;"how plainly
I see the great goodness of God in all that has happened. At first it
was very dark, and I struggled against the cruelty of that arrest, and
the unjust sentence which branded me before the world. I forgot that the
Son of God was thus assailed, thus branded! and worse still, put to
death, that Christianity might be our inheritance. I did not know what
great happiness might spring out of this degradation; how holy a work
lay waiting for me in that prison!"</p>

<p>"My poor girl, it was a terrible life for you. Can God forgive me for
bringing you there?"</p>

<p>"Nelson, this is wrong&mdash;it is unkind! It was to be; God knew what was
best, and sent me in the path of a great duty against my will, or I
never should have found it. He had compassion on those poor creatures so
barbarously cut off from every thing sweet and good in life. They were
perishing or turning to demons for the want of a little care, a few kind
words, a smile of pity now and then. I was poor as poor could be,
helpless as a child, but these things I could give them; so he thought
it best that I should go.</p>

<p>"I was rebellious at first, Nelson, and wondered how it could be that I,
an innocent woman, should suffer among the guilty. I was so young, so
weak, and miserably selfish. Besides, I hoped so fondly that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span> would
come back and save me. But they were dragging me away from all
possibility of seeing you."</p>

<p>"My poor Katharine!"</p>

<p>"Oh, it was hard! it was hard!" she said, laying her forehead on his
shoulder; "for I thought you loved me! I thought you loved me!"</p>

<p>He drew her head close to his bosom, but said nothing; self-reproach
held his heart in silence.</p>

<p>"With this hope of seeing you again, rising above every thing, it was a
cruel thought that you might come home and find me there, think perhaps
that I had harmed your child."</p>

<p>"No, Katharine&mdash;no, I never could have believed that. In my most insane
moments I knew and felt how good you were."</p>

<p>"But these thoughts would come to me in my prison, Nelson; I could not
help that. So I struggled against that hard fate and wanted to die. The
people were wrong and harsh with me, the law was wrong, the judges were
wrong, but God was right."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I was the most cruel of all," said Thrasher, in a low, pained voice.</p>

<p>"Still it was all needful. What else would have won me from home to live
among those poor convicts, to help them and feel for them, till a
beautiful happiness sprang up to me out of those dreary mines. Then,
then," she added, with a gush of tender gratitude, "just as I had
learned to live and endure for others, knowing that God's wisdom was
higher than man's justice, you came, my husband, and I had the power to
help you. I so weak, and you so strong! From that day I knew how great a
blessing had been won for me, out of what seemed the deadly ruin of a
life. In that black depth I found the heart of my husband."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
"Oh, a worthless, wicked heart, Katharine!"</p>

<p>"But it was mine&mdash;all mine!"</p>

<p>He girded her closer with his arm, and that was answer enough.</p>

<p>"Then you began to trust me, and believe in me, Nelson; as a strong man
lets some little child lead him, because of its very helplessness; you
listened to me and loved me&mdash;for you do love me, Nelson!"</p>

<p>"The God you worship so beautifully, Katharine, only knows how much I
love you!"</p>

<p>"Oh, we shall be very happy!" answered the young woman, bowing her head,
while a soft rain of tears fell down her cheeks. "Every soul in the
prison loved us. God has forgiven us!"</p>

<p>"Not us, Katharine! It is I that have need of His pardon; not you, my
wife!"</p>

<p>But in her sweet humility she would not have it so, and protested
against it. "No, no; I was untamed, impatient, disobedient to my mother.
In a woman these are great sins. We are equal there as in the mercies
which fall around us now."</p>

<p>Thrasher was a man of few words, but his wife understood this, and saw,
by the emotion in his face, how deeply his spirit was touched.</p>

<p>They fell into silence after this, and rode on slowly, thinking of those
they were about to meet. The wagon rolled heavily up Falls Hill, turned
at the old willow tree, and passed up the Bungy road approaching the old
homestead.</p>

<p>They came to Mrs. Allen's house first. It was dark and still as the
grave. Why was this? The hour did not warrant such dreary darkness, such
utter solitude.</p>

<p>Katharine, who was leaning eagerly forward, fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span> back with a heavy
sigh. Was her mother dead? Had sorrow broken her heart at last? Was it a
tomb to which she had come, after eight long years of imprisonment?</p>

<p>They left the wagon, and knocked at the door. There was no footstep
within. No answering voice. Not even a gleam of fire light to speak of
an existing household.</p>

<p>They returned to the wagon without speaking, and drove slowly over the
hill; very slowly, for that empty house had filled them with painful
forebodings.</p>

<p>From the butternut tree they got a first sight of the old homestead.
From the sitting room window a steady light was burning, which fell upon
a great snowball bush, turning the huge white blossoms that covered it
into globes of gold. "They are alive; they are at home!" said Thrasher.
"God be thanked!"</p>

<h2><a name="lxxvii" id="lxxvii"></a>CHAPTER LXXVII.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">THE CONVICT'S RETURN.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Old</span> Mr. Thrasher and his wife sat together that night in the very room
in which they had been blessed by the first return of their son. He had
been away weary, weary years now, and not a word of tidings had ever
reached them. But the old hope was there. The faith which nothing but a
certainty of his death could destroy. There they sat, as on that night,
waiting for him, not with absolute hope, but from that tender unbelief
which will not give up a loved one.</p>

<p>This evening they were not alone. An old woman, very thin and withered,
but with a certain hard stateliness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span> hanging around her, sat near the
hearth. A hood and shawl, lying on the table near the door, proved that
she had only come in for a brief visit. There was not much conversation
among them. Mrs. Allen had just received a letter from her son, who had
shipped in the India trade from Liverpool, and had not been home for
years. Now he was on a return voyage, and having saved money enough, was
resolved to leave the sea and take to farming with his mother.</p>

<p>It was a kind letter, and spoke most affectionately of the young sister
who was, as he thought, pining to death in the prison mines at Simsbury.</p>

<p>The old man put on his spectacles and read the letter aloud. Mrs. Allen
listened with interest, as if she had not already got the contents by
heart. Old Mrs. Thrasher stopped short in her knitting, and sighed
heavily. What a comfort it was to get a letter from one's son! Would she
ever see another from Nelson? Just then the sound of wagon wheels coming
over the hill reached them. He stopped reading and listened; why, no one
could tell, for wagons passed that road every half hour in the
twenty-four. As the wagon approached, these three old people looked at
each other with vague bewilderment, and listened like persons in
expectation. It stopped before the house. The gate opened. Mrs. Thrasher
leaned forward, listening. "It is his step!"</p>

<p>That good woman had said exactly these same words years before, when
some brown threads darkened her hair, which was white as snow now.</p>

<p>The old man now arose, so did Mrs. Allen, for she heard a step beyond
that which sounded on the gravel walk&mdash;something so light that it could
have reached no intelligence save the ever-watchful love of a mother.</p>

<p>They all stood and listened&mdash;no one of them had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span> strength enough to
move. The door was opened&mdash;those steps advanced up the entry way, and
paused there. Then a hand, which shook the latch it touched, opened the
door, and the old people saw their son, and behind him, the sweet, pale
face of Katharine, his wife. The lamp light lay full upon them, but the
old people were blinded by a sweet rush of love that made their hearts
swell again, and could not see distinctly. The old man went forward.</p>

<p>"My son, my son!"</p>

<p>They were strong men, this father and son, but they fell into each
other's arms and wept like children.</p>

<p>Then the old man gave way to his wife, and taking Katharine from her
mother's bosom, laid both hands on her head and blessed her.</p>

<p>After the first outgush of welcome, Nelson Thrasher turned to his wife.</p>

<p>"Father," he said, "it is this woman, my wife, whom you must thank&mdash;she
who suffered innocently, that I might be given back to my home. It was
for your son she waited after they had set her free, for I have been her
fellow-prisoner. Oh, father! I have sinned against Heaven, and in thy
sight, and am no longer worthy to be called thy son."</p>

<p>Tears were raining down the old man's face&mdash;his arms were extended, and
he cried out:</p>

<p>"Oh, my son, my son! what is thy innocence or guilt to us, when God has
forgiven?" Again the old man fell upon his son's bosom and wept.</p>

<p>When Katharine's head was uncovered, and the old people had wiped away
their tears, the change which had taken place in that young couple
struck them with fresh thrills of tenderness. Thrasher's hair was
threaded with silver, and the face it shadowed bore proofs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span> suffering
which no after time could efface, but the serene strength which sprang
out of his new life, gave something of grandeur to his features. There
was no look of concealment in it now, but he met his father's eyes with
the open frankness of boyhood.</p>

<p>The dear old lady could not be satisfied with one embrace, but hovered
around her son in a birdlike flutter, smoothed his hair with her plump
little palm, and laid her cheek lovingly against it, whispering, "My
poor boy, my poor dear boy."</p>

<p>Katharine had been whispering to her mother; her face became anxious;
she was evidently pleading for something. At last the stiff old woman
arose, and going up to Thrasher laid one hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Nelson Thrasher, I know the wrong you have done my daughter. My son
told me all before he went his voyage to the Indies. He charged me to
keep it secret, and I have. She begs me to pardon it, and I will. Nelson
Thrasher, I forgive you, as I pray God to forgive my own sins."</p>

<p>Thrasher bowed his head; the solemnity of the old woman went to his
soul. After a moment his face was slowly lifted, and his eyes looked
into hers.</p>

<p>"I thank you," he said, gently. "Katharine, tell her that she can trust
you with me now."</p>

<p>Katharine came to his side, smiling.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother; for he loves me; and I, oh, you know how it was always
with me."</p>

<p>"And now you will live with us," said Mrs. Thrasher, hovering around her
son, troubled in her heart that any one should claim a word or look.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, we have come to the homestead to end our days. Here, among
our old neighbors, we will redeem the good name which has been forfeited
by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span> your son, and innocently lost by this dear girl. Where else can we
turn? Let our neighbors know all; we will have nothing to do with
concealments, but meet their kindness or condemnation fairly. In time
they will learn to like us again&mdash;for her sake I hope it, and will toil
for it."</p>

<p>"We will always stand by our children; wont we Mrs. Allen?"</p>

<p>It was the soft, cooing voice of Mrs. Thrasher which uttered these
words. "The neighbors like us, and wont be harsh with them. If they
should, you know we are company among ourselves." The dear old woman
turned her mild brown eyes from Mrs. Allen to her husband, questioning
them both.</p>

<p>The old man smiled.</p>

<p>"Our son is right; let him start life once more among his old
neighbors."</p>

<p>And so it was settled among them, in the stillness of that night, after
Nelson Thrasher had revealed every thing to his parents.</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="lxxviii" id="lxxviii"></a>CHAPTER LXXVIII.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">TOM HUTCHINS' QUARREL.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> church bell was ringing cheerfully on Falls Hill. Indeed, on a day
like that, every sound took a jubilant tone. The sunshine was so bright,
the meadows and foliage so richly green, that one breathed deeply with a
keen sense of enjoyment.</p>

<p>The birds in the pine woods made a perfect riot of music among the
trees, and built their nests lovingly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span> in defiance of blue laws, and
forgetful&mdash;as birds will be sometimes&mdash;that it was the Sabbath day. Even
pretty little humming-birds came out in force that morning, and shook
the trumpet honeysuckles like mad things, buzzing their wings, and
setting the great bumble bees that haunted the clover fields a most
indecorous example. Such quantities of fennel as was cut from the green
stalks that morning and tied into dainty bunches, ready to be nibbled at
in church. Such pretty bouquets of violets and wild roses were
made&mdash;such lovely new bonnets and muslin dresses as appeared that day
for the first time&mdash;I can neither describe or enumerate.</p>

<p>"What was it all about?"</p>

<p>Why a confirmation, a wedding, and a double baptism were to come off
that day, performed by the bishop himself. No wonder all Chewstown came
over from that side of the river. No wonder that Falls Hill, Bungy, and
Shrub Oak&mdash;to say nothing of the factory flats&mdash;should be one scene of
commotion! The wedding of itself would have been enough to set people
wild. Why the bride was pretty Rose Mason, that little girl who used to
live with her handsome mother down in the pine woods; the sweetest
creature that the sun ever shone upon, and just as beautiful now; in
fact, more so.</p>

<p>"Who was she going to marry?"</p>

<p>Did any one remember a remarkably handsome little fellow who came to
board with Mrs. Allen, in Bungy, about the time that Katy Allen&mdash;well,
they would not say any thing about that; poor thing, she had suffered
enough&mdash;but he went to school at Shrub Oak, and was a perfect little
gentleman. His name was Paul De Varney, and he had come out so rich that
no one could count his gold.</p>

<p>There was but one thing that could be said against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span> the match&mdash;young De
Varney brought a black slave with him when he first came into the State,
and kept him still, for the poor fellow had been about Bungy not two
days ago, and no doubt was there yet. The bishop might have something to
say about that before he would marry the young man; but it was to be
hoped that it would not quite break up the match. Still, a slave in old
Connecticut! that could not be thought of a moment by any Christian
community. Certainly Nelson Thrasher and his wife would be
confirmed&mdash;that was all settled with the bishop, who had been informed
about the case thoroughly by Thrasher himself; as for his wife, people
were beginning to think that after all she had been innocent about that
affair. A woman that could kill her own child never yet made a wife like
her. Why those old people fairly worshipped her. When old Mrs. Thrasher
was sick, she never had her clothes off for weeks together. Then she was
so good in sickness; always the first to offer herself, if watchers were
wanted. Why Tom Hutchins might have lost his young wife if it had not
been for her care. Night and day, night and day, that faithful woman was
by her bedside, till the fever left her. The doctor had been heard to
declare, over and over again, that he should not know how to get along
with his patients if it were not for Mrs. Nelson Thrasher. Then Nelson
had turned out such a sensible, steady man, for all his hard life. Yes,
yes; the thing was certain; both he and his wife would be confirmed. No
doubt of that.</p>

<p>Then about the baptism; of course that was for Tom Hutchins' twins&mdash;a
girl and a boy that you could not tell apart to save your life. Tom and
his wife were so proud of those young ones they never would be content
till all the town had seen them in their long white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span> christening
dresses. That young fellow did make such a fool of himself. Just as if
nobody had ever had twins to baptize before him.</p>

<p>All this gossip was pretty nearly true. The bishop had come, and was
stopping at the square white house near the willow tree. Paul De Varney
was staying at Mrs. Allen's with Jube. David Rice had built a large side
building to the old house, since he settled on the farm, and it was
plenty large enough to accommodate half a dozen guests if they could
have been persuaded to stay. But when Mr. Prior the minister, and his
little wife, came from Bays Hollow, bringing Rose Mason back to be
married in her native village, they went directly up to old Mrs.
Thrasher's and made the homestead cheerful with company.</p>

<p>Since the arrival of all these people in the village, Tom Hutchins, who
lived in Mrs. Mason's cottage in the pine woods, had been wonderfully
busy, and gave himself up to his friends more completely than could be
expected of a young married man, not two months before made the father
of healthy twins, good as gold and plump as partridges.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this paternal drawback, Tom had made all arrangements
with regard to the bishop; had seen the publishment properly laid on the
pulpit cushion, ready for use, three legal Sundays, and had twice driven
his steel colored colt into New Haven, to get a pair of satin slippers
and a certain kind of ribbon for Rose, at which his wife pouted, and the
twins, partaking of her ill humor, kept the poor fellow walking the
chamber floor half the night, now with one, and then with the other, in
his arms.</p>

<p>I am afraid Mrs. Hutchins did not, on that occasion, take quite her
share of the nursing. When Tom asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span> her, in his distress, if she
wouldn't get up and make a little fennel seed tea for the poor little
things, she desired to know if it wouldn't be just as well to make that
request of Rose Mason, with her curls and her gipsy hat on one side, at
which Tom broke forth with energy:</p>

<p>"Talk about Rose Mason," he said; "the girl that was going to marry his
earliest friend, one of the finest fellows on earth&mdash;a girl that was
good as gold, and generous as&mdash;Oh it was too bad; he wouldn't have
thought it of a wife of his&mdash;a woman that he had loved so."</p>

<p>"<i>Had</i> loved!" Mrs. Hutchins murmured, faintly. "<i>Had</i> loved!"</p>

<p>Tom's heart melted within him as he heard the low protest, but he
contented himself by kissing each of the twins, while their little heads
rested on his shoulders, and went on making an iron-hearted fellow of
himself.</p>

<p>Yes, Tom meant <i>had</i>. No love in the world could stand such venomous
attacks on that nice girl, who had given him up so handsomely. Where
would she have been but for that? Breaking her heart, and pining herself
to death, instead of taking her place as a respectable married person
and the head of a thriving family. There was the twins, too, precious
dears. Par wasn't scolding them. Where in the world would they have been
if Rose had kept him to his word, as any other girl would have done?</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Hutchins began to sob, and said, penitently, that she hadn't
meant any thing of the kind&mdash;in fact, hadn't said a single thing against
Miss Rose Mason, who was breaking her heart though; and&mdash;and&mdash;oh, dear,
if she'd only stayed at home with her own dear par and mar, instead of
marrying a man that didn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span> love her, and was keeping her poor babies
out in the cold just to break her heart.</p>

<p>"There, there! just snuggle the little shavers up to you, that's a
darling!" cried Tom, huddling the two babies into their mother's arms,
and leaving a penitential kiss somewhere in the borders of her cap.
"I'll kindle the fire and make some tea myself&mdash;I know you didn't mean
it."</p>

<p>"Indeed I didn't, Tom. But you mustn't do it; I will."</p>

<p>"There now, keep quiet, or you'll set 'em a-going again."</p>

<p>"No, Tom, they're both sound asleep."</p>

<p>"You don't say so. Well, they've got me wide awake, anyhow; so I'll just
light a candle and show you what I really was doing in New Haven, and
what Rose Mason wanted me to buy for her."</p>

<p>Tom unlocked a closet that held his cravats and
<a name="Sunday" id="Sunday"></a><ins title="Original has sunday">Sunday</ins>
clothes, from which he took a long, deep paper box, and carried it to
the bed.</p>

<p>"See here!" he cried, lifting up a garment so white and soft that it
seemed woven from snow-flakes. "Two of 'em, just alike; India muslin
that her father sent from Calcutta, she told me to tell you. See how
they are worked round the bottom, and cut up with lace. Then, here's the
caps! One of 'em just fits my fist. It was to get the ribbon for these
cockades she sent me to New Haven&mdash;white for the gal, and blue for the
boy. Now what do you think about it?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Hutchins thought that she was the most silly, unreasonable,
good-for-nothing creature that ever lived; but she hoped, for all, that
Tom wouldn't say <i>had</i> again. It was too cruel, even if she was to
blame.</p>

<p>Tom admitted that he was a hard-hearted, cruel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span> tiger of a fellow, and
not worth half the love she gave him; and so the young couple were
reconciled.</p>



<hr />

<h2><a name="lxxix" id="lxxix"></a>CHAPTER LXXIX.<br />
<br />
<span class="sub">THE WEDDING AND THE BAPTISM.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Notwithstanding</span> this little domestic scene, Tom stood by his friends
bravely; "he was bound to see this wedding put through in style, let
what would come." Mrs. Hutchins was a wise little lady in her day, and
kept quiet after this; but she insisted on having a new straw bonnet
with white ribbons, and would have worn her own wedding dress only Tom
objected, and said it would be like putting on airs, and she the head of
a family; that dove-colored silk would do beautifully.</p>

<p>So the afternoon came, as I have said, and the bell rang out loud and
cheerfully, sounding out an invitation to every lady from Rock Rimmond
to Castle Rock. Then the people came pouring in from Bungy, Shrub Oak,
Chewstown, and Pine Island in a perpetual storm. The old barn-like
Presbyterian meeting-house in Chewstown was deserted by all except the
most aged members, and the school-house where the little handful of
Methodists worshipped, had to close its doors, for no one but the class
leader presented himself for admission. So the church was crowded.</p>

<p>Those who could not gain access were scattered in groups on the green in
front, and a crowd took shelter under the old willow at the crossroads,
determined to get a good view of that young foreigner who was going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span> to
marry pretty Rose Mason. People said he was handsome as a lord, and rich
as a prince. Of course he should be all that to carry off the prettiest
girl that ever lived in the town, to say nothing of her goodness. Of
course everybody remembered Captain Mason and his handsome wife. She was
dead, poor woman; but Captain Mason had given up his ship, and was going
to France with his daughter and her young husband. Wasn't it strange
that Captain Rice should have got into company like that? And Tom
Hutchins. The young couple are going to take tea at Tom's house after
the ceremony. Strange, wasn't it? But then Tom always was stumbling into
some good fortune.</p>

<p>While these remarks were going on the people within the church were lost
in admiration of the rare flowers&mdash;white roses and white lilies&mdash;that
shed their fragrance over the altar. The same perfume which was to float
around the bride would first consecrate the penitents who came forward
for confirmation.</p>

<p>They came up the broad aisle slowly and with downcast eyes&mdash;a man and
his wife, only those two. The bishop stood ready. Every eye was upon
them; some turned away in hard contempt, some looked pitifully on the
young woman who, innocent or guilty, had suffered so much. How beautiful
she was. With what meek grace she knelt down and bowed her head where
the shadow of her trouble had fallen so early. And the man, how quiet
and self-centered he was, giving his soul up to its holy work, without a
thought of those who looked on. Handsome; yes, he was more than
handsome, with that glow upon his face; but it only came once, when her
eyes were uplifted to his, after that a solemn sadness fell upon him.</p>

<p>That group of old people, and that open-faced seafaring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span> man, standing
near the altar. Certainly that was her mother, and the little woman
standing close to the old man, was his mother, and the seafaring man was
Captain Rice, her half brother. How completely they seemed absorbed by
the kneeling couple. Well, after all there must be some excuse&mdash;crime
did not seem natural to such people, or to the children of that honest
couple. God must have touched their hearts.</p>

<p>Thus the prejudices of the congregation softened, and gave way under the
spiritual influence of that holy rite which stamped those who had been
condemned criminals as Christians before the Lord.</p>

<p>When Katharine arose from her consecration and moved back, some of her
old schoolmates looked kindly upon her, and one opened the pew door,
thus inviting her to a seat. At this a flush came over her pale face,
and you could see quick tears swelling under her eyelids.</p>

<p>After these two people were lost sight of, another group appeared in the
aisle. A noble young man, with those soft, velvety eyes, that are at
once so languid and so bright, and a fair young creature, crowned with
white jessamines, and floating in a cloud of gossamer lace, whose cheeks
wore a flush of wild roses, and whose lips trembled between smiles and
tears. No bridesmaids were in attendance, but a tall, grave man, whom
everybody recognized as the bride's father, walked with them to the
altar, and gave her away, with a look of tender sadness that seemed
habitual to his noble face.</p>

<p>The bridal party stepped aside from the altar to make room for another
couple, and then Tom Hutchins and his wife came up the broad aisle with
blushes and smiles chasing each other across their faces as pride and
strength shone in those young hearts. The man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span> carried an infant in his
arms, whose soft face dimpled in response to its father's smiles, and
which wore a blue rosette in the mass of soft lace that formed its cap.
The woman looked fresh as a wild rose in her bonnet with white ribbons
and a dove-colored silk adown which the long white christening dress of
the girl baby floated mistily, while the rosette on its cap fluttered
like a white poppy in the wind.</p>

<p>Paul and Rose, these names were duplicated at the altar with due
sprinkling of water-drops from a fount wreathed with flowers. Then Tom
Hutchins and his wife walked down the aisle again, looking grave and
thoughtful, as if they had just begun to realize what it was to be the
father and mother of human souls, whose pilgrimage is through all
eternity.</p>

<p>In violation of the usual custom, a colored man was accommodated with a
seat near the door, whose glowing face and genial smile made every one
in his vicinity brighten with pleasant sympathy. He was so occupied with
the ceremony that he had not regarded a little group of persons who
stood just outside the church, conversing eagerly together. At last one
of these men came and touched him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>Jube, used to obedience, arose and followed the man into the centre of
the group that was evidently waiting for him, and looked around in some
surprise, for they were all strangers.</p>

<p>"I say," said one of the men, making mysterious signals with his
fingers, "now's your time, while everybody is looking on the
christening. There's my horse and wagon; take you to New Haven in an
hour; steamboat ready. We've made a little contribution. Here's two
silver dollars, and you'll find some doughnuts in the wagon seat with a
chunk of cheese. Liberty's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span> the word. Leave the horse at Buck's tavern
in Chapel street, till sent for."</p>

<p>Jube turned from one face to another, wondering what they wanted of him.</p>

<p>"Don't be skeered, and look so wild," said the first speaker, "we'll
stand by you; it's our bounden duty as Christians. So jump in while you
have a chance."</p>

<p>Of course Jube had learned a good deal of English in all the years that
he had been in America; but he spoke brokenly, and had some difficulty
in commanding words when taken by surprise.</p>

<p>"What you want ob Jube? Where shall he jump?"</p>

<p>"Out of slavery into liberty," was the answer. "Run away from the young
man who owns you for his slave."</p>

<p>"Slave! slave!&mdash;what for Jube run away from young master? What for who
says so&mdash;Jube happy very much."</p>

<p>"But you are a slave!"</p>

<p>Jube laughed till all his white teeth shone again:</p>

<p>"Jube like slave."</p>

<p>"He makes you work for nothing!"</p>

<p>Jube looked down at his brawny frame, and laughed again.</p>

<p>"Come, cuff, make haste!" cried the man whose wagon was waiting, "you've
no time to lose. They'll be coming out soon, and then it's all day with
your chance."</p>

<p>In his eager philanthropy, the man put his arm through Jube's, and
attempted to drag him toward the willow tree, where his horse was
fastened, but Jube shook him off.</p>

<p>"Jube ride behind young masser and Miss Rose. He happy there."</p>

<p>"Poor fellow," said the man, in a broken-hearted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span> voice. "He don't know
what freedom is. Let him go. It's too late now; they're coming."</p>

<p>True enough, Paul De Varney and his bride were walking down the broad
aisle of the church&mdash;he with a smile on his lips, and she with a warm
flush of roses on her cheeks. Behind them came Hutchins and his family.</p>

<p>A carriage was drawn up at the door, ready to carry the bridal pair to
Tom Hutchins' house, in the pine woods. Jube sprang forward to open the
carriage door, and held his arm down to save that snowy bridal dress
from a contact with the wheels.</p>

<p>Rose smiled upon him as she entered the carriage, and touched his
shoulder, as if for support, which brought a blessing upon her in Jube's
broken English.</p>

<p>When Paul took his seat, Jube seized his hand and kissed it, thus giving
his congratulations before those who would have lured him away in the
kindness of their ignorance. The faithful fellow felt as if his master
had been slandered when these men called him a slave, and so he was.</p>

<p>Directly after the carriage drove off, a smart, little one-horse wagon,
yellow as an orange, took its place, and over the wheel leaped our
friend Tom Hutchins, who waited, with the reins in his hand, till a
little woman, with an infant on each arm, came out of the crowd. Tom
took the boy baby in one arm, and held his horse with the other, till
the little woman clambered over the front wheel to her seat. Then, after
smoothing down its complication of garments, he settled the little
trooper, as he called it, by its twin in their young mother's lap, gave
a leap to her side, and, with an old-fashioned crack of the whip, dashed
after the wedding carriage.</p>

<p>Not till most of the congregation had left the church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span> did Nelson
Thrasher come forth with his wife, circled, as it were, by the old
people, and supported by Captain Rice.</p>

<p>The bishop left his vestry and came with them, talking in a low, kind
voice to Katharine for some moments on the steps of the church, when he
left her with a fatherly shake of the hand. Several of the matrons and
girls who had held aloof till then, came up and gave both Nelson and
herself a cordial greeting. It was known that they had been invited to
join the wedding party, and that young De Varney had left Thrasher in
charge of his property during his proposed absence in Europe. This proof
of confidence had a wonderful effect on the old neighbors, and quite a
little group gathered around the husband and wife, giving them generous
God speed.</p>

<p>Neither Katharine or her husband cared to join that bridal party down in
the pine woods. The day had been too impressive and solemn for that. But
with serene faces and hearts full of gratitude, they entered the
one-horse wagon that waited for them and followed the old folks slowly
over the Bungy hills.</p>

GET UP YOUR CLUBS FOR 1866!</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="books center">PETERSON'S MAGAZINE.</p>

<p class="center">DOUBLE-SIZE COLORED STEEL FASHION PLATES!</p>

<p>For many years "Peterson's Magazine" has had a larger circulation, than
any other monthly in the United States. In 1866 it will be greatly
improved: <i>The reading matter will be increased</i>, <span class="smcap">and each number will
contain a Double-Size Steel Fashion Plate, elegantly colored</span>, with from
four to six figures: making "Peterson" more desirable than ever! The
terms will remain <i>two dollars a year</i>, with liberal deductions to
clubs. Containing nearly one thousand pages annually, fourteen steel
engravings, twelve double-size fashion plates, and eight hundred
wood-cuts, it will be, in 1866, beyond all question,</p>

<p class="center"><b>THE CHEAPEST MAGAZINE IN THE WORLD.</b></p>

<p>The novelets and tales are acknowledged to be the very best. <i>More money
is paid for original stories than by any other Magazine of the kind.</i> In
1866, in addition to the usual array of shorter stories, <span class="smcap">Four
Copy-righted Novelets will be given</span>, viz:</p>

<p class="noi condensed nb">THE SOLDIER'S ORPHANS, by Mrs. Ann St. Stephens.</p>
<p class="right3 condensed nt nb">THE STOLEN BOND, by the Author of "The Second Life."</p>
<p class="noi condensed nt nb">THE OLD MILL OF AMOSKEAG, by the Author of "Susy L's Diary"</p>
<p class="right3 condensed nt">Mrs. SHODDY'S SKELETON, by Frank Lee Benedict</p>


<p>In its Illustrations also, "Peterson" is unrivalled. The Publisher
challenges a comparison between its</p>

<p class="center">SUPERB MEZZOTINTS &amp; other STEEL ENGRAVINGS</p>

<p class="center">And those in other Magazines, and one at least is given in each number.</p>

<p class="center">DOUBLE-SIZE COLORED FASHION PLATES</p>

<p>Each number will contain a double-size Fashion plate, engraved on steel
and handsomely colored. These plates will be <i>twice the size of those
heretofore given</i>: and will excel anything of the kind yet seen. In
addition, wood-cuts of the newest bonnets, hats, caps, head-dresses,
cloaks, jackets, ball dresses, walking dresses, house dresses, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
will appear in each number. Also, the greatest variety of children's
dresses. Also, a diagram, by aid of which a cloak, dress, or child's
costume can be cut out, without the aid of a mantua-maker, so that each
number, in this way alone, <i>will save a year's subscription</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>COLORED PATTERNS IN BERLIN WORK, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>No other Magazine gives the beautiful and expensive patterns for Berlin
Work, &amp;c., printed in colors, for which "Peterson" is celebrated. Many
of these, at a retail store, would cost fifty cents. These will be kept
up. Each number will also give patterns in Crochet, Embroidery,
Knitting, &amp;c., &amp;c.,</p>

<p class="center cursive">RECEIPTS FOR COOKERY, THE TOILET, &amp;C., &amp;C.</p>

<p>Carefully tested receipts will appear monthly, for the Table, the
Toilet, the Sick Room, the Nursery, &amp;c. Also, hints on Horticulture,
Furnishing, &amp;c. These alone, at the end of the year, will be worth the
price of the Magazine. <span class="smcap">A piece of New and Fashionable Music</span> in each
number.</p>

<p>A CHOICE OF PREMIUMS. Where a person is entitled to an extra copy for
getting up a Club, there will be sent, if preferred, instead of the
extra copy, a superb premium mezzotint for framing, (size 27 inches by
20,) "<span class="smcap">Washington parting from his Generals</span>," or a <span class="smcap">Lady's Illustrated
Album</span>, handsomely bound and gilt. <i>Always state whether an extra copy,
or one of these other premiums, is preferred</i>: and notice that for Clubs
of three or four, no premiums are given. <span class="smcap">In remitting</span>, get a post-office
order or a draft on Philadelphia or New York: if neither of these can be
had, send green-backs or bank notes.</p>
